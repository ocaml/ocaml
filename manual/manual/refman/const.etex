constant:
    integer-literal

The syntactic class of constants comprises literals from the four
base types (integers, floating-point numbers, characters, character
strings), and constant constructors from both normal and polymorphic
variants, as well as the special constants @"false"@, @"true"@, @"("")"@,
@"[""]"@, and @"[|""|]"@, which behave like constant constructors, and
@"begin" "end"@, which is equivalent to @'('')'@.
