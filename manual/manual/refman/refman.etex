This document is intended as a reference manual for the OCaml
language. It lists the language constructs, and gives their precise
syntax and informal semantics. It is by no means a tutorial
introduction to the language: there is not a single example. A good
working knowledge of OCaml is assumed.

No attempt has been made at mathematical rigor: words are employed
with their intuitive meaning, without further definition. As a
consequence, the typing rules have been left out, by lack of the
mathematical framework required to express them, while they are
definitely part of a full formal definition of the language.


\subsection*{ss:notations}{Notations}

The syntax of the language is given in BNF-like notation. Terminal
symbols are set in typewriter font (@'like' 'this'@).
Non-terminal symbols are set in italic font (@like that@).
Square brackets @[\ldots]@ denote optional components. Curly brackets
@{\ldots}@ denotes zero, one or several repetitions of the enclosed
components. Curly brackets with a trailing plus sign @{{\ldots}}@
denote one or several repetitions of the enclosed components.
Parentheses @(\ldots)@ denote grouping.
