\chapter{The num library: arbitrary-precision rational arithmetic}
%HEVEA\cutname{libnum.html}

The "num" library implements integer arithmetic and rational
arithmetic in arbitrary precision. It was split off the core
OCaml distribution starting with the 4.06.0 release, and can now be found
at \url{https://github.com/ocaml/num}.

New applications that need arbitrary-precision arithmetic should use the
"Zarith" library (\url{https://github.com/ocaml/Zarith}) instead of the "Num"
library, and older applications that already use "Num" are encouraged to
switch to "Zarith". "Zarith" delivers much better performance than "Num"
and has a nicer API.
