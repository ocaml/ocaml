\chapter{Using Caml Light under Emacs} \label{c:emacs}

This chapter describes how Caml Light can be used in conjunction with
Gnu Emacs version 19 (version 18 is also partially supported).

\begin{unix} The Emacs Lisp files implementing the Caml/Emacs
interface are in "contrib/camlmode" in the distribution.
\end{unix}

\begin{macos} The Caml/Emacs interface is not available. \end{macos}

\begin{pc} The Caml/Emacs interface is not available. \end{pc}

\section{Updating your ".emacs"}

The following initializations must be added to your ".emacs" file:
\begin{verbatim}
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.ml[iylp]?" . caml-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(autoload 'caml-mode "caml" "Major mode for editing Caml code." t)
(autoload 'run-caml "inf-caml" "Run an inferior Caml process." t)
(autoload 'camldebug "camldebug" "Run the Caml debugger." t)
\end{verbatim}

\section{The "caml" editing mode}

The "caml-mode" function is a major editing mode for Caml source
files. It provides the correct syntax tables, comment syntax,
\ldots\ for the Caml language. An extremely crude indentation facility
is provided, as well as a slightly enhanced "next-error" command (to
display the location of a compilation error). The following key
bindings are performed:

\begin{options}
\item["TAB" (function "caml-indent-command")]
At the beginning of a line, indent that line like the
line above. Successive "TAB"s increase the indentation level by 2
spaces (by default; can be set with the "caml-mode-indentation"
variable).

\item["M-TAB" (function "caml-unindent-command")]
Decrease the indentation level of the current phrase.

\item["C-x `" (function "caml-next-error")]
Display the next compilation error, just as "next-error"
does. In addition, it puts the point and the mark around the exact
location of the error (the subexpression that caused the error). Under
Emacs 19, that subexpression is also highlighted.

\item["M-C-h" (function "caml-mark-phrase")]
Mark the Caml phrase that contains the point: the point
is put at the beginning of the phrase and the mark at the end. Phrases
are delimited by ";;" (the final double-semicolon). This function does
not properly ignore ";;" inside string literals or comments.

\item["C-x SPC"]
When the Caml debugger is running as an inferior process
(section~\ref{s:inf-debugger} below), set a breakpoint at the current
position of the point.

\item["M-C-x" or "C-c C-e" (function "caml-eval-phrase")]
When a Caml toplevel is running as an
inferior process (section~\ref{s:inf-caml} below), send it the
the Caml phrase that contains the point. The phrase will then be
evaluated by the inferior toplevel as usual. The phrase is delimited
by ";;" as described for the "caml-mark-phrase" command.

\item["C-c C-r" (function "caml-eval-region")]
Send the region to a Caml toplevel running in an inferior process.

\end{options}

\section{Running the toplevel as an inferior process} \label{s:inf-caml}

"M-x run-caml" starts a Caml toplevel with input and output in an Emacs
buffer named "*inferior-caml*". This gives you the full power of Emacs
to edit the input to the Caml toplevel. An history of input lines is
maintained, as in Shell mode. This includes the following commands
(see the function "comint-mode" for a complete description):

\begin{options}
\item["RET"] Send the current line to the toplevel.
\item["M-n" and "M-p"] Move to the next or previous line in the
history.
\item["M-r" and "M-s"] Regexp search in the history.
\item["C-c C-c"] Send a break (interrupt signal) to the Caml toplevel.
\end{options}

Phrases can also be sent to the Caml toplevel for evaluation from any
buffer in Caml mode, using "M-C-x", "C-c C-e" or "C-c C-r".

\section{Running the debugger as an inferior process} \label{s:inf-debugger}

The Caml debugger is started by the command "M-x camldebug", with
argument the name of the executable file \var{progname} to debug. 
Communication with the debugger takes place in an Emacs buffer named 
"*camldebug-"\var{progname}"*". The editing and history facilities of
Shell mode are available for interacting with the debugger.

In addition, Emacs displays the source files containing the current
event (the current position in the program execution) and highlights
the location of the event. This display is updated synchronously with
the debugger action.

The following bindings for the most common debugger commands are
available in the "*camldebug-"\var{progname}"*" buffer (see
section~\ref{s:debugger-commands} for a full explanation of the
commands):

\begin{options}
\item["M-r"] "run" command: execute the program forward.
\item["M-s"] "step" command: execute the program one step forward.
\item["M-b"] "back" command: execute the program one step backward.
\item["M-l"] "last" command: go back one step in the command history.
\item["C-c >"] "down" command: select the stack frame below the
current frame.
\item["C-c <"] "up" command: select the stack frame above the
current frame.
\item["C-c C-f"] "finish" command: run till the current function
returns.
\end{options}

In a buffer in Caml editing mode, "C-x SPC" sets a breakpoint at the
current position of the point.
