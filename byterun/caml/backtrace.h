/* Runtime support for backtrace generation.
 *
 * It has two kind of users:
 * - high-level API to capture and decode backtraces;
 * - low-level runtime routines, to introspect machine state and determine
 *   whether a backtrace should be generated when using "raise".
 *
 * Backtrace generation is split in multiple steps.
 * The lowest-level one, done by [backtrace_prim.c] just fills the
 * [caml_backtrace_buffer] variable each time a frame is unwinded.
 * At that point, we don't know whether the backtrace will be useful or not so
 * this code should be as fast as possible.
 *
 * If the backtrace happens to be useful, later passes will read
 * [caml_backtrace_buffer] and turn it into a [raw_backtrace] and then a
 * [backtrace].
 * This is done in [backtrace.c] and [stdlib/printexc.ml].
 *
 * Content of buffers
 * ------------------
 *
 * [caml_backtrace_buffer] (really cheap)
 *   Backend and process image dependent, abstracted by C-type backtrace_slot.
 * [raw_backtrace] (cheap)
 *   OCaml values of abstract type [Printexc.raw_backtrace_slot],
 *   still backend and process image dependent (unsafe to marshal).
 * [backtrace] (more expensive)
 *   OCaml values of algebraic data-type [Printexc.backtrace_slot]
