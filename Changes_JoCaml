- JoinPool bug: nagain was decremented twice!

JoCaml 3.12.0

- Corrected bug in typing : arguments of join-patterns must
  get unified, channel per channel, before compiling algebraic
  patterns in join-patterns. Reason: the compilation assumes
  that patterns are type-correct.

- Added new librairy JoinTextProc

- Corrected subtle threading bug in JoinProc: fork & parent channels
  closing in critical section.
 
- Added new librairy JoinCom [producer/consumers, previously in JoinFifo]

- Added new librairies JoinHelper, JoinPool and JoinProc (replacement
  for Unix fork/exec helpers, which are not thread safe at all)

- Corrected incorrect handling of channel names in object bodies. Costly
  (bug #1, rev 10200)
