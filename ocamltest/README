# Introduction

## Purpose

The OCaml compiler's testsuite consists of a set of programs that
are compiled and run by a set of makefiles to see whether the results
they produce match the expected results.

The aim of ocamltest is to replace the makefiles for compiling and
running the tests and then checking their results, given that the exact way
each test should be compiled and executed is specified in a dedicated
comment appearing at the beginning of the main test file.

## Constraints

It may look odd at first glance to write the tool used to test the
compiler in its target language. There are, however, parts of the
compiler and the standard library that are already tested in a way,
namely those used to compile the compiler itself. Therefore, these
components can be considered more trustworthy than those that have
not yet been used and that's
why ocamltst relies only on the part of the stdlib that has been
used to develop the compiler itself.

This excludes for instance the use of the Unix and Str libraries.

# Initial set-up

Define the following environment variables:

export OCAMLSRCDIR=/path/to/your/clone/of/ocaml/sources
export OCAMLTESTDIR=/tmp/ocamltest

OCAMLTESTDIR represents the directory where tests will be built
It is expected to be outside of the source tree.

Then, compile OCaml:

./configure
make world.opt
make tests

The last command will compile all the prerequisites of tets and run them.

In particular, it is worth noting that, by default, when
ocamltest encounters a toplevel test, it will run it under both bytecode
and native toplevels, so that ocamlnat becomes a prerequisite for
certain tests.

# Running tests

(all the commands below are assumed to be run from OCAMLSRCDIR/testsuite)

From here, one can:

## Run all tests: make all

This runs the complete testsuite. Thhis includes the "legacy" tests
that still use the makefile-based infrastructure and the "new" tests
that have been migrated to use ocamltest.

## Run legacy tests: make legacy

## Run new tests: make new

## Run tests manually

It is convenient to have the following ocamltest script in a directory
appearing in PATH, like ~/bin:

#!/bin/sh
TERM=dumb OCAMLRUNPARAM= ${OCAMLSRCDIR}/ocamltest/ocamltest.byte $*

Once this file has been made executable, one can for instance run:

ocamltest tests/basic-io/wc.ml

As can be seen, ocamltest's output looks similar to the legacy format. 

This is to make the transition between the makefile-based
infrastructure and ocamltest as smooth as possible. Once all the
tests will have been migrated to ocamltest, it will become possible to
change this output format.

The details of what exactly has been tested can be found in
${OCAMLTESTDIR}/tests/basic-io/wc/wc.log

One can then have a look to tests/basic-io/wc.ml to see how the file
had to be annotated to produce such a result.

Other tests have also already been migrated and it may be useful to see
how the test files have been annotated.

git log tests

gives a list of tests that have been modified and can therefore be used
as starting points to understand what ocamltest can do.

# Migrating tests from makefiles to ocamltest

It may be a good idea to run make new from the testsuite directory before
starting to migrate tests. This will show how many "new" tests there
already are.

Then, when running make new after having migrated n tests,
the number of new tests reported by make new should have increased by n.

OCaml's testsuite is divided into directories, each of them
containing one or several tests, which can each consist of one or
several files.

Thus, directories are the smallest unit that can be migrated.

To see which directories still need to be migrated, do:

find tests -name 'Makefile'

In other words, the directories that still need to be migrated are all
the directories of testsuite/tests that still contain a Makefile.

Once you knwo which directory you want to migrate, say foo, here is how
you can do:

Read foo/Makefile to see how many tests the directory contains and how
they are compiled. If the makefile only includes other makefiles and
does not define any variable, then it means that nothing special
has to be done to compile or run the tests.

For each test, annotate its main file with a test block, i.e. a
comment that looks like this:

(* TEST
  Optional variable assignments and tests
*)

In particular, if the test's main file is foo.ml and the test uses
modules m1.ml and m2.ml, the test block will look like ths:

(* TEST
  modules = "m1.ml m2.ml"
*)

And if the test consists of a single file foo.ml that needs to be
run under the top-level, then its test block will look like this:

(* TEST
  * toplevel
*)

Or, if there are two reference files for that test and the name
of one of them contains "principal", then it means the file should
be tested with the toplevel, without and with the -principal option.
This is expressed as follows:

(* TEST
  * toplevel
  * toplevel
    include principal
*)

Lines starting with stars indicate which tests to run. If no test is
specified, then the tests that are enabled by default are used,
namely to compile the test program with both bytecode and native
compilers, roughly speaking.

Once your test has been annotated, run ocamltest on it and see
whether it passes or fails. If it fails, see the log file to understand why
and make the necessary adjustments until all the tests pass.

The adjustments will mostly consist in renaming reference files and
updating their content.

Note that there are different types of refrence files, those for
compiler output and those for program output.

Once this has been done for all tests, create a file called "ocamltests"
(mark the final s!) and containing the names of all the files that
have been annotated for ocamltest, one per line.

Finally, git rm the Makefile and run make new from the testsuite directory
to make sure the number of new tests has increased as expected.
