  (** We want to optimize nested constructors, for example:

      {[
        (x () :: y () :: tmc call)
      ]}

      which would naively generate (in a DPS context parametrized
      over a location dst.i):

      {[
        let dstx = x () :: Placeholder in
        dst.i <- dstx;
        let dsty = y () :: Placeholder in
        dstx.1 <- dsty;
        tmc dsty.1 call
      ]}

      when we would rather hope for

      {[
        let vx = x () in
        let dsty = y () :: Placeholder in
        dst.i <- vx :: dsty;
        tmc dsty.1 call
      ]}

      The idea is that the unoptimized version first creates a
      destination site [dstx], which is then used by the following
      code.  If we keep track of the current destination:

      {[
        (* Destination is [dst.i] *)
        let dstx = x () :: Placeholder in
        dst.i (* Destination *) <- dstx;
        (* Destination is [dstx.1] *)
        let dsty = y () :: Placeholder in
        dstx.1 (* Destination *) <- dsty;
        (* Destination is [dsty.1] *)
        tmc dsty.1 call
      ]}

      Instead of binding the whole newly-created destination, we can
      simply let-bind the non-placeholder arguments (in order to
      preserve execution order), and keep track of a list of blocks to
      be created along with the current destination.  Instead of seeing
      a DPS fragment as writing to a destination, we see it as a term
      with shape [dst.i <- C .] where [C .] is a linear context consisting
      only of constructor applications.

      {[
        (* Destination is [dst.i <- C .] *)
        let vx = x () in
        (* Destination is [dst.i <- C (vx :: .)] *)
        let vy = y () in
        (* Destination is [dst.i <- C (vx :: vy :: .)] *)
        (* Making a call: reify the destination *)
        let dsty = vy :: Placeholder in
        dst.i <- vx :: dsty;
        tmc dsty.1 call
      ]}

      The [delayed] argument represents the context [C] as a list of
      reified constructors, to allow both to build the final holey
      block ([vy :: Placeholder]) at the recursive call site, and
      the delayed constructor applications ([vx :: dsty]).

      In practice, it is not desirable to perform this simplification
      when there are multiple TMC calls (e.g. in different branches of
      an [if] block), because it would cause duplication of the nested
      constructor applications.  The [delayed_use_count] field keeps track
      of this information, it counts the number of syntactic use sites
      of the delayed constructors, if any, in the generated code.

(** The TMC transformation requires information flows in two opposite
    directions: the information of which callsites can be rewritten in
    destination-passing-style flows from the leaves of the code to the
    root, and the information on whether we remain in tail-position
    flows from the root to the leaves -- and also the knowledge of
    which version of the function we currently want to generate, the
    direct version or a destination-passing-style version.

    To clarify this double flow of information, we split the TMC
    transform in two steps:

    1. A function [choice t] that takes a term and processes it from
    leaves to root; it produces a "code choice", a piece of data of
    type [lambda Choice.t], that contains information on how to transform the
    input term [t] *parameterized* over the (still missing) contextual
    information.

    2. Code-production operators that have contextual information
    to transform a "code choice" into the final code.

    The code-production choices for a single term have type [lambda Choice.t];
    using a parametrized type ['a Choice.t] is useful to represent
    simultaneous choices over several subterms; for example
    [(lambda * lambda) Choice.t] makes a choice for a pair of terms,
    for example the [then] and [else] cases of a conditional. With
    this parameter, ['a Choice.t] has an applicative structure, which
    is useful to write the actual code transformation in the {!choice}
    function.

  (**
     An ['a Choice.t] represents code that may be written
     in destination-passing style if its usage context allows it.
     More precisely:

     - If the surrounding context is already in destination-passing
       style, it has a destination available, we should produce the
       code in [dps] -- a function parametrized over the destination.

     - If the surrounding context is in direct style (no destination
       is available), we should produce the fallback code from
       [direct].

      (Note: [direct] is also a function (on [unit]) to ensure that any
      effects performed during code production will only happen once we
      do know that we want to produce the direct-style code.)

     - [tmc_calls] tracks the function calls in the subterms that are
       in tail-modulo-cons position and get rewritten into tailcalls
       in the [dps] version.

     - [benefits_from_dps] is true when the [dps] calls strictly more
       TMC functions than the [direct] version. See the
       {!choice_makeblock} case.

     - [explicit_tailcall_request] is true when the user
       used a [@tailcall] annotation on the optimizable callsite.
       When one of several calls could be optimized, we expect that
       exactly one of them will be annotated by the user, or fail
       because the situation is ambiguous.

           Calling [choice_makeblock] on the K constructor, we need to
           determine whether its two arguments are ambiguous, which is
           done by calling [choice] on each argument to see if they
           would be TMC-able and if they are explicitly annotated.

           These calls give the following results:
           - there is an explicitly-requested tailcall in the first
             argument
           - the second argument is a nested pair whose arguments
             themselves are ambiguous -- with no explicit annotation.

           This determines that the arguments of K are not ambiguous,
           as only one of them is annotated. But note that the nested
           pair, in isolation, is ambiguous. This inner ambiguity is
           innocuous and should not result in an error, as we never
           use this inner pair in TMC position, only in direct style.

           This example shows that it would be incorrect to fail with
           an error whenever [choice] finds an ambiguity. Instead we
           only error when generating the [dps] version of the
           corresponding code; requesting the [direct] version is
           accepted and produces the expected direct code.
