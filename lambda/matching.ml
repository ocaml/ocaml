(* Compilation of pattern matching

   Based upon Lefessant-Maranget ``Optimizing Pattern-Matching'' ICFP'2001.

   A previous version was based on Peyton-Jones, ``The Implementation of
   functional programming languages'', chapter 5.


   Overview of the implementation
   ==============================

       1. Precompilation
       -----------------

     (split_and_precompile)
   We first split the initial pattern matching (or "pm") along its first column
   -- simplifying pattern heads in the process --, so that we obtain an ordered
   list of pms.
   For every pm in this list, and any two patterns in its first column, either
   the patterns have the same head, or their heads match disjoint sets of
   values. (In particular, two extension constructors that may or may not be
   equal due to hidden rebinding cannot occur in the same simple pm.)

       2. Compilation
       --------------

   The compilation of one of these pms obtained after precompiling is done as
   follows:

     (divide)
   We split the match along the first column again, this time grouping rows
   which start with the same head, and removing the first column.
   As a result we get a "division", which is a list a "cells" of the form:
         discriminating pattern head * specialized pm

     (compile_list + compile_match)
   We then map over the division to compile each cell: we simply restart the
   whole process on the second element of each cell.
   Each cell is now of the form:
         discriminating pattern head * lambda

     (combine_constant, combine_construct, combine_array, ...)
   We recombine the cells using a switch or some ifs, and if the matching can
   fail, introduce a jump to the next pm that could potentially match the
   scrutiny.

       3. Chaining of pms
       ------------------

     (comp_match_handlers)
   Once the pms have been compiled, we stitch them back together in the order
   produced by precompilation, resulting in the following structure:
   {v
       catch
         catch
           <first body>
         with <exit i> ->
           <second body>
       with <exit j> ->
         <third body>
   v}

   Additionally, bodies whose corresponding exit-number is never used are
   discarded. So for instance, if in the pseudo-example above we know that exit
   [i] is never taken, we would actually generate:
   {v
       catch
         <first body>
       with <exit j> ->
         <third body>
   v}

  (** Half-simplified patterns are patterns where:
        - records are expanded so that they possess all fields
        - aliases are removed and replaced by bindings in actions.

      Or-patterns are not removed, they are only "half-simplified":
        - aliases under or-patterns are kept
        - or-patterns whose right-hand-side is subsumed by their lhs
          are simplified to their lhs.
          For instance: [(_ :: _ | 1 :: _)] is changed into [_ :: _]
        - or-patterns whose left-hand-side is not simplified
          are preserved: (p|q) is changed into (simpl(p)|simpl(q))

  (* Consider the following matching problem involving a half-simple pattern,
     with an or-pattern and as-patterns below it:

       match arg, other-args with
       | (Foo(y, z) as x | Bar(x, y) as z), other-pats -> action[x,y,z]

     (action[x,y,z] is some right-hand-side expression using x, y and z,
      but we assume that it uses no variables from [other-pats]).

     [explode_or_pat] explodes this into the following:

       match arg, other-args with
       | Foo(y1, z1), other-pats -> let x1 = arg in action[x1,y1,z1]
       | Bar(x2, y2), other-pats -> let z2 = arg in action[x2,y2,z2]

     notice that the binding occurrences of x,y,z are alpha-renamed with
     fresh variables x1,y1,z1 and x2,y2,z2.

     We assume that it is fine to duplicate the argument [arg] in each
     exploded branch; in most cases it is a variable (in which case
     the bindings [let x1 = arg] are inlined on the fly), except when
     compiling in [do_for_multiple_match] where it is a tuple of
     variables.

(** A default environment (referred to as "reachable trap handlers" in the
    paper) is an ordered list of [raise_num * matrix] pairs, mapping reachable
    exit numbers to the matrices of the corresponding exit handler.

    It is used to decide where to jump next if none of the rows in a given
    matrix match the input.

    In such situations, one thing you can do is to jump to the first (leftmost)
    [raise_num] in that list (by doing a raise to the static-cach handler number
    [raise_num]); and you can assume that if the associated pm doesn't match
    either, it will do the same thing, etc.
    This is what [mk_failaction_neg] (and its callers) does.

    But in fact there is no point in jumping to a matrix if you can tell
    statically that it cannot match your current input. Default environments
    provide static information on what happens "after" each jump, which we use
    to optimize our exit choices.
    This is what [mk_failaction_pos] (and its callers) does.

    The default environment also carries a special [final_exit] exit
    number, which is used for values that are not matched by any
    clauses of the matching being compiled. The final exit is treated
    as a free variable, it is not bound in the [raise_num * matrix]
    list. When [Default_environment.pop] returns [None], there are no
    exit handlers to matching clauses left, but
    (for non-exhaustive matches) inputs could still jump to the final
    exit.

(*
  Split a matching along the first column.

    Splitting is first directed by or-patterns, then by
    tests (e.g. constructors)/variable transitions.

    The approach is greedy, every split function attempts to
    raise rows as much as possible in the top matrix,
    then splitting applies again to the remaining rows.

    Some precompilation of or-patterns and
    variable pattern occurs. Mostly this means that bindings
    are performed now,  being replaced by let-bindings
    in actions (cf. Half_simple.of_clause).

    Additionally, if the match argument is a variable, matchings whose
    first column is made of variables only are split further
    (cf. precompile_var).

  ---

  Note: we assume that the first column of each pattern is coherent -- all
  patterns match values of the same type. This comes from the fact that
  we make aggressive splitting decisions, splitting pattern heads that
  may be different into different submatrices; in particular, in a given
  submatrix the first column is formed of first arguments to the same
  constructor.

  GADTs are not an issue because we split columns left-to-right, and
  GADT typing also introduces typing equations left-to-right. In
  particular, a leftmost column in matching.ml will be well-typed under
  a set of equations accepted by the type-checker, and those equations
  are forced to remain consistent: they can equate known types to
  abstract types, but they cannot equate two incompatible known types
  together, and in particular incompatible pattern heads do not appear
  in a leftmost column.

  Parmatch has to be more conservative because it splits less
  aggressively: submatrices will contain not just the arguments of
  a given pattern head, but also other lines that may be compatible with
  it, in particular those with a leftmost omega and those starting with
  an extension constructor that may be equal to it.

     where the first and second rows start with disjoint or-patterns
     of simple patterns, binding the variables x2, y2, z2 and x3, y3
     respectively, we precompile into the following:

     catch

     | exit 3 x3 y3 ->
       ( match arg2 .. argn with
       | p32 .. p3n -> act3 )

     Note that if arg1 matches s21 or s'21, we exit to a submatrix
     that will never try any of the following rows; this relies on the
     disjointness-like properties documented in the {!Or_matrix}
     module.

     The code below builds this catch/exit structure, The splitting of
     the or-patterns is done in [Simple.explode_or_pat] -- it turns
     half-simple clauses into simple clauses.

  (* This function should be called when a debug-producing function

     The format boxes used for debug pretty-printing must use @, as

     with indentation, where extraneous cuts give ugly output, so we
     do not want to place a cut before each item or after each item.)

     Each debug-outputting function can assume that it starts on a new
     line, and is expected to *not* include a cut the end of its
     output. The glue code that calls those functions is responsible
     for placing separator cut @, between them.

     In most cases we know statically that some output was produced
     and some other output will follow, and place a cut separator @,
     at the right places in the debug format strings. But sometimes it
     is not obvious in the code that a separator is needed. This

(* In [mk_failaction_pos partial seen ctx defs],
   - [partial] indicates whether the current switch
     is exhaustive
   - [seen] is the list of constructors accepted by the switch
     (those that will be matched)
   - [ctx] is the current context (what we know of the value
     being matched)
   - [defs] is the default environment (what inputs
     are expected by the switches present at larger exit numbers).

   The function returns a triple [(fail, fails, jumps)] containing
   information for the failure cases, the constructors missing from
   the current switch:
   - [fail] is an optional 'default' action for the switch
   - [fails] is a list of extra switch clauses to add for failure cases,
     each jumping to a larger exit number
   - [jumps] contains a jump summary for all these new cases
     (context information for all exits they reach)

   The general strategy is to compute an accurate list of [fails] and
   try to avoid having a default action, as this generates better
   code. But we choose to have a default action when the list [fails]
   would be too large or too costly to compute.

   Through its jump summary, [mk_failaction_pos] propagates "negative
   information" about the constructors not taken. For example, if
   a switch only accepts the [None] constructor, [mk_failaction_pos]
   generates a failure clause along with context information that the
   value reaching the failure clause must be [Some _].

         native-code compilation. (Optimizations that only work well
         for one backend should be done in the backend.)

         The [Lswitch] construct is generally an excellent choice, as
         it generates a single instruction in bytecode, and can be
         turned into efficient, simpler control-flow constructs in
         native-code. (The lambda/switch.ml module is precisely
         responsible for efficiently compiling switches to simpler
         tests.)

         Some additional optimizations make sense here when they let
         us generate better code, including in bytecode: the generated
         code should still fit in one bytecode instruction or less.

         [Lswitch] has the downside of always needing a byte per
         constructor in the generated bytecode, even when many actions
         are shared. For types with a lot of constructors, calling the
         switcher directly can result in more compact code. This is

(* Note on [compute_arg_partial].

   Partiality information is provided by the
   type-checker. A pattern-matching is compiled as Total if the
   type-checker verified that any well-typed value of the scrutinee
   type is matched by at least one unguarded clause.

   The pattern-matching compiler also tracks information relevant to
   partiality/exhaustiveness: it checks that a switch on constructors
   is 'complete' (all constructors at that type are matched), and it
   carries fine-grained context information that allows to determine
   that some incomplete switches are in fact exhaustive
   (missing constructors were matched previously), or refine
   information about which constructors are left to match for the
   following switches.

   Sometimes the pattern-matching compiler cannot tell that a switch
   on an argument is complete, but the type-checker can. This is the
   case in particular for GADTs -- the compiler does not use type
   information to rule certain constructors out.

     type _ t =
       | Int : int -> int t
       | Bool : bool -> bool t

     let total_function : int t -> int = function
       | Int n -> n

   In these cases we want to trust the type-checker totality
   information to generate better code: we know that the only possible
   constructor is [Int], so we can generate branchless code that
   fetches its argument directly. Users rely on this performant
   compilation scheme for GADTs.

   Trusting the totality information also lets us avoid computing
   fine-grained 'negative' information, which can avoid some
   pathological cases for pattern-matching compilation. (The vast
   majority of 'match' and 'function' uses in practice are total.)

   On the other hand, there are cases where the type-checker wrongly
   believes that a matching is total, because its totality criterion
   (all well-typed values are matched by a non-guarded clause) ignores
   side-effects.

     let r = ref (Some 42)

     let () = match Some r with
       | { contents = None } -> 0
       | _ when (r := None; false) -> 1
       | { contents = Some n } -> n

   In this example, the pattern-matching compiler will notice that the
   [Some n] case is not total (this is thanks to the use of
   [set_args_erase_mutable] in Context.combine), but the type-checker
   believes that it is total, so that the only possible value reaching
   the third clause has a [Some] constructor. Trusting the
   type-checker would lead us to generate a direct field access to the
   [Some] argument, which is unsound as the value at this point has
   become [None].

   The job of [compute_arg_partial] is to combine the totality
   information coming from the type-checker and contextual information
   provided by the compiler to decide whether a switch on a given
   argument should be considered partial or not, in a way that is
   correct but does not pessimize too many code patterns.

   The criterion that we use is based on two contextual informations:

   - [mut]: is the current sub-value we are switching over placed
     (transitively) under a mutable field?

   - [tempo]: is this always the first switch on this position,
     or did some value jump here after coming from previous submatrices
     that may already have switched on the position?

   If [mut = Mutable], that is we are in a transitivitely mutable position,
   and [tempo = Following], this may not be the first switch on this position,
   then we pessimize totality information.

   Remark: when we split a matrix into several submatrices that have
   to be tried in turn, and the original matrix was in a [Total]
   context, we compile all submatrices as [Partial] except for the
   very last one that remains [Total] -- see
   {!comp_match_handlers}. And that very last matrix will be
   a [Following] matrix, unless there was no actual split -- we split
   into only one matrix. The criterion above can thus be understood
   as: either we are at an [Immutable] position, or there was no
   actual split from the root of the pattern-matching to the current
   submatrix.

   With this criterion, pure patterns are never pessimized, but even
   patterns that have some GADTs and some non-GADT mutable components
   work well -- for example, a pair of a GADT value and
   a reference. On the other hand, matching on GADTs inside
   a reference is pessimized when the GADT matching occurs under
   a mutable constructor and after a split.

       When compiling this example, [immut] will be matched first, and
       each case will perform a [None] check and also jump to a shared
       exit handler containing the [Some n] clause. The field access
       to the [mut] field will be emitted three times, in each branch
       of the switch and in the shared handler.

       In the general case, the value of the mutable field may change

       another thread or domain), so we must be careful not to

(* Optimize binding of immediate tuples

   The goal of the implementation of 'for_let' below, which replaces
   'simple_for_let', is to avoid tuple allocation in cases such as
   this one:

     let (x,y) =
        let foo = ... in
        if foo then (1, 2) else (3,4)
     in bar

   The compiler easily optimizes the simple `let (x,y) = (1,2) in ...`
   case (call to Matching.for_multiple_match from Translcore), but
   didn't optimize situations where the rhs tuples are hidden under
   a more complex context.

   The idea comes from Alain Frisch who suggested and implemented
   the following compilation method, based on Lassign:

     let x = dummy in let y = dummy in
     begin
      let foo = ... in
      if foo then
        (let x1 = 1 in let y1 = 2 in x <- x1; y <- y1)
      else
        (let x2 = 3 in let y2 = 4 in x <- x2; y <- y2)
     end;
     bar

   The current implementation from Gabriel Scherer uses Lstaticcatch /
   Lstaticraise instead:

     catch
       let foo = ... in
       if foo then
         (let x1 = 1 in let y1 = 2 in exit x1 y1)
       else
        (let x2 = 3 in let y2 = 4 in exit x2 y2)
     with x y ->
       bar

   The catch/exit is used to avoid duplication of the let body ('bar'
   in the example), on 'if' branches for example; it is useless for
   linear contexts such as 'let', but we don't need to be careful to
   generate nice code because Simplif will remove such useless
   catch/exit.

(* The 'opt' reference indicates if the optimization is worthy.

   It is shared by the different calls to 'assign_pat' performed from
   'map_return'. For example with the code
     let (x, y) = if foo then z else (1,2)
   the else-branch will activate the optimization for both branches.

   That means that the optimization is activated if *there exists* an
   interesting tuple in one hole of the let-rhs context. We could
   choose to activate it only if *all* holes are interesting. We made
   that choice because being optimistic is extremely cheap (one static
   exit/catch overhead in the "wrong cases"), while being pessimistic
   can be costly (one unnecessary tuple allocation).
