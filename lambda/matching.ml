(* Compilation of pattern matching

   Based upon Lefessant-Maranget ``Optimizing Pattern-Matching'' ICFP'2001.

   A previous version was based on Peyton-Jones, ``The Implementation of
   functional programming languages'', chapter 5.


   Overview of the implementation
   ==============================

       1. Precompilation
       -----------------

     (split_and_precompile)
   We first split the initial pattern matching (or "pm") along its first column
   -- simplifying pattern heads in the process --, so that we obtain an ordered
   list of pms.
   For every pm in this list, and any two patterns in its first column, either
   the patterns have the same head, or their heads match disjoint sets of
   values. (In particular, two extension constructors that may or may not be
   equal due to hidden rebinding cannot occur in the same simple pm.)

       2. Compilation
       --------------

   The compilation of one of these pms obtained after precompiling is done as
   follows:

     (divide)
   We split the match along the first column again, this time grouping rows
   which start with the same head, and removing the first column.
   As a result we get a "division", which is a list a "cells" of the form:
         discriminating pattern head * specialized pm

     (compile_list + compile_match)
   We then map over the division to compile each cell: we simply restart the
   whole process on the second element of each cell.
   Each cell is now of the form:
         discriminating pattern head * lambda

     (combine_constant, combine_construct, combine_array, ...)
   We recombine the cells using a switch or some ifs, and if the matching can
   fail, introduce a jump to the next pm that could potentially match the
   scrutiny.

       3. Chaining of pms
       ------------------

     (comp_match_handlers)
   Once the pms have been compiled, we stitch them back together in the order
   produced by precompilation, resulting in the following structure:
   {v
       catch
         catch
           <first body>
         with <exit i> ->
           <second body>
       with <exit j> ->
         <third body>
   v}

   Additionally, bodies whose corresponding exit-number is never used are
   discarded. So for instance, if in the pseudo-example above we know that exit
   [i] is never taken, we would actually generate:
   {v
       catch
         <first body>
       with <exit j> ->
         <third body>
   v}

  (** Half-simplified patterns are patterns where:
        - records are expanded so that they possess all fields
        - aliases are removed and replaced by bindings in actions.

      Or-patterns are not removed, they are only "half-simplified":
        - aliases under or-patterns are kept
        - or-patterns whose right-hand-side is subsumed by their lhs
          are simplified to their lhs.
          For instance: [(_ :: _ | 1 :: _)] is changed into [_ :: _]
        - or-patterns whose left-hand-side is not simplified
          are preserved: (p|q) is changed into (simpl(p)|simpl(q))

  (* Consider the following matching problem involving a half-simple pattern,
     with an or-pattern and as-patterns below it:

       match arg, other-args with
       | (Foo(y, z) as x | Bar(x, y) as z), other-pats -> action[x,y,z]

     (action[x,y,z] is some right-hand-side expression using x, y and z,
      but we assume that it uses no variables from [other-pats]).

     [explode_or_pat] explodes this into the following:

       match arg, other-args with
       | Foo(y1, z1), other-pats -> let x1 = arg in action[x1,y1,z1]
       | Bar(x2, y2), other-pats -> let z2 = arg in action[x2,y2,z2]

     notice that the binding occurrences of x,y,z are alpha-renamed with
     fresh variables x1,y1,z1 and x2,y2,z2.

     We assume that it is fine to duplicate the argument [arg] in each
     exploded branch; in most cases it is a variable (in which case
     the bindings [let x1 = arg] are inlined on the fly), except when
     compiling in [do_for_multiple_match] where it is a tuple of
     variables.

             We are careful to avoid binding [arg] if not needed due

(** A default environment (referred to as "reachable trap handlers" in the
    paper), is an ordered list of [matrix * raise_num] pairs, and is used to
    decide where to jump next if none of the rows in a given matrix match the
    input.

    In such situations, one thing you can do is to jump to the first (leftmost)
    [raise_num] in that list (by doing a raise to the static-cach handler number
    [raise_num]); and you can assume that if the associated pm doesn't match
    either, it will do the same thing, etc.
    This is what [mk_failaction_neg] (and its callers) does.

    A more sophisticated alternative is to use what you know about the input
    (what you might already have matched) and the current pm (what you know you
    can't match) to directly jump to a pm that might match it instead of the
    next one; that is why we don't just keep [raise_num]s but also the
    associated matrices.
    [mk_failaction_pos] does (a slightly more sophisticated version of) this.

     The property that we want to maintain for the rows of the
     or-matrix is that if the row p::ps is before q::qs and p is an
     or-pattern, and v::vs matches p but not ps, then we don't need to
     try q::qs. This is necessary because the compilation of the
     or-pattern p will exit to a sub-matrix and never come back.

     For this to hold, (p::ps) and (q::qs) must satisfy one of:
     - disjointness: p and q are not compatible
     - ordering: if p and q are compatible, ps is more general than qs
       (this only works if the row p::ps is not guarded; otherwise the
        guard could fail and q::qs should still be tried)

(*
  Split a matching along the first column.

    Splitting is first directed by or-patterns, then by
    tests (e.g. constructors)/variable transitions.

    The approach is greedy, every split function attempts to
    raise rows as much as possible in the top matrix,
    then splitting applies again to the remaining rows.

    Some precompilation of or-patterns and
    variable pattern occurs. Mostly this means that bindings
    are performed now,  being replaced by let-bindings
    in actions (cf. Half_simple.of_clause).

    Additionally, if the match argument is a variable, matchings whose
    first column is made of variables only are split further
    (cf. precompile_var).

  ---

  Note: we assume that the first column of each pattern is coherent -- all
  patterns match values of the same type. This comes from the fact that
  we make aggressive splitting decisions, splitting pattern heads that
  may be different into different submatrices; in particular, in a given
  submatrix the first column is formed of first arguments to the same
  constructor.

  GADTs are not an issue because we split columns left-to-right, and
  GADT typing also introduces typing equations left-to-right. In
  particular, a leftmost column in matching.ml will be well-typed under
  a set of equations accepted by the type-checker, and those equations
  are forced to remain consistent: they can equate known types to
  abstract types, but they cannot equate two incompatible known types
  together, and in particular incompatible pattern heads do not appear
  in a leftmost column.

  Parmatch has to be more conservative because it splits less
  aggressively: submatrices will contain not just the arguments of
  a given pattern head, but also other lines that may be compatible with
  it, in particular those with a leftmost omega and those starting with
  an extension constructor that may be equal to it.

     disjointness-like properties documented in the {!Or_matrix}
     module.

(* The entry points *)

(*
   If there is a guard in a matching or a lazy pattern,
   then set exhaustiveness info to Partial.
   (because of side effects, assume the worst).

   Notice that exhaustiveness information is trusted by the compiler,
   that is, a match flagged as Total should not fail at runtime.
   More specifically, for instance if match y with x::_ -> x is flagged
   total (as it happens during JoCaml compilation) then y cannot be []
   at runtime. As a consequence, the static Total exhaustiveness information
   have to be downgraded to Partial, in the dubious cases where guards
   or lazy pattern execute arbitrary code that may perform side effects
   and change the subject values.
LM:
   Lazy pattern was PR#5992, initial patch by lpw25.
   I have  generalized the patch, so as to also find mutable fields.

(* Optimize binding of immediate tuples

   The goal of the implementation of 'for_let' below, which replaces
   'simple_for_let', is to avoid tuple allocation in cases such as
   this one:

     let (x,y) =
        let foo = ... in
        if foo then (1, 2) else (3,4)
     in bar

   The compiler easily optimizes the simple `let (x,y) = (1,2) in ...`
   case (call to Matching.for_multiple_match from Translcore), but
   didn't optimize situations where the rhs tuples are hidden under
   a more complex context.

   The idea comes from Alain Frisch who suggested and implemented
   the following compilation method, based on Lassign:

     let x = dummy in let y = dummy in
     begin
      let foo = ... in
      if foo then
        (let x1 = 1 in let y1 = 2 in x <- x1; y <- y1)
      else
        (let x2 = 3 in let y2 = 4 in x <- x2; y <- y2)
     end;
     bar

   The current implementation from Gabriel Scherer uses Lstaticcatch /
   Lstaticraise instead:

     catch
       let foo = ... in
       if foo then
         (let x1 = 1 in let y1 = 2 in exit x1 y1)
       else
        (let x2 = 3 in let y2 = 4 in exit x2 y2)
     with x y ->
       bar

   The catch/exit is used to avoid duplication of the let body ('bar'
   in the example), on 'if' branches for example; it is useless for
   linear contexts such as 'let', but we don't need to be careful to
   generate nice code because Simplif will remove such useless
   catch/exit.

(* The 'opt' reference indicates if the optimization is worthy.

   It is shared by the different calls to 'assign_pat' performed from
   'map_return'. For example with the code
     let (x, y) = if foo then z else (1,2)
   the else-branch will activate the optimization for both branches.

   That means that the optimization is activated if *there exists* an
   interesting tuple in one hole of the let-rhs context. We could
   choose to activate it only if *all* holes are interesting. We made
   that choice because being optimistic is extremely cheap (one static
   exit/catch overhead in the "wrong cases"), while being pessimistic
   can be costly (one unnecessary tuple allocation).
