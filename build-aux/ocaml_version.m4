# This file contains all the macros used to describe the current version of
# OCaml. It first defines the basic components and then computes all
# the different variants of the version used across the build system.

# For the M4 macros defined below, we use the OCAML__ (with a double
# underscore) to distinguish them from the C preprocessor macros which
# use a single underscore, since the two families of macros coexist
# in configure.ac.

# The following macro, OCAML__DEVELOPMENT_VERSION, should be either
# [true] of [false].

m4_define([OCAML__DEVELOPMENT_VERSION], [true])

# The three following components (major, minor and patch level) MUST be
# integers. They MUST NOT be left-padded with zeros and all of them,
# including the patchlevel, are mandatory.

m4_define([OCAML__VERSION_MAJOR], [5])
m4_define([OCAML__VERSION_MINOR], [00])
m4_define([OCAML__VERSION_PATCHLEVEL], [0])
# Note that the OCAML__VERSION_EXTRA string defined below is always empty
# for officially-released versions of OCaml.
m4_define([OCAML__VERSION_EXTRA], [dev0-2021-11-05])

# The OCAML__VERSION_EXTRA_PREFIX macro defined below should be a
# single character:
# Either [~] to mean that we are approaching the OCaml public release
# OCAML__VERSION_MAJOR.OCAML__VERSION_MINOR.OCAML__VERSION_PATCHLEVEL
# and with an empty OCAML__VERSION_EXTRA string;
# Or [+] to give more info about this specific version.
# Development releases, for instance, should use a [+] prefix.
m4_define([OCAML__VERSION_EXTRA_PREFIX], [+])

# Generate the VERSION file
# The following command is invoked when autoconf is run to generate configure
# from configure.ac, not while configure itself is run.
# In other words, both VERSION and configure are produced by invoking
# autoconf (usually done by calling tools/autogen for this project)

# Starting with OCaml 4.14, although the version string that appears above is
# still correct and this file can thus still be used to figure it out,
# the version itself is actually defined in the build-aux/ocaml_version.m4
# file (See the OCAML__VERSION* macros there.)
# To update the present VERSION file:
# 1. Update build-aux/ocaml_version.m4
# 2. Run tools/autogen.
# 3. If you are in a context where version control matters,
# commit the changes to both build-aux/ocaml_version.m4 and VERSION.
# The version string must be in the format described in stdlib/sys.mli
