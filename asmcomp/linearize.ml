  (* We expect [Lprologue] to expand to at least one instruction---as such,
     if no prologue is required, we avoid adding the instruction here.
     The reason is subtle: an empty expansion of [Lprologue] can cause
     two labels, one either side of the [Lprologue], to point at the same
     location.  This means that we lose the property (cf. [Coalesce_labels])
     that we can check if two labels point at the same location by
     comparing them for equality.  This causes trouble when the function
     whose prologue is in question lands at the top of the object file
     and we are emitting DWARF debugging information:
       foo_code_begin:
       foo:
       .L1:
       ; empty prologue
       .L2:
       ...
     If we were to emit a location list entry from L1...L2, not realising
     that they point at the same location, then the beginning and ending
     points of the range would be both equal to each other and (relative to
     "foo_code_begin") equal to zero.  This appears to confuse objdump,
     which seemingly misinterprets the entry as an end-of-list entry
     (which is encoded with two zero words), then complaining about a
     "hole in location list" (as it ignores any remaining list entries
     after the misinterpreted entry). *)
