type machtype_component =
  | Val
  | Addr
  | Int
  | Float

(* - [Val] denotes a valid OCaml value: either a pointer to the beginning
     of a heap block, an infix pointer if it is preceded by the correct
     infix header, or a 2n+1 encoded integer.
   - [Int] is for integers (not necessarily 2n+1 encoded) and for
     pointers outside the heap.
   - [Addr] denotes pointers that are neither [Val] nor [Int], i.e.
     pointers into the heap that point in the middle of a heap block.
     Such derived pointers are produced by e.g. array indexing.
   - [Float] is for unboxed floating-point numbers.

The purpose of these types is twofold.  First, they guide register
allocation: type [Float] goes in FP registers, the other types go
into integer registers.  Second, they determine how local variables are
tracked by the GC:
   - Variables of type [Val] are GC roots.  If they are pointers, the
     GC will not deallocate the addressed heap block, and will update
     the local variable if the heap block moves.
   - Variables of type [Int] and [Float] are ignored by the GC.
     The GC does not change their values.
   - Variables of type [Addr] must never be live across an allocation
     point or function call.  They cannot be given as roots to the GC
     because they don't point after a well-formed block header of the
     kind that the GC needs.  However, the GC may move the block pointed
     into, invalidating the value of the [Addr] variable.
