(* The "open!" directive below is necessary because, although
   this module does not actually depend on Schedgen in this backend, the
   dependency exists in other backends and our build system requires
   that all the backends have the same dependencies.
   We thus have to use "open!" and disable the corresponding warning
   only for this compilation unit.

open! Schedgen [@@warning "-66"]

(* Scheduling is turned off because the processor schedules dynamically
   much better than what we could do. *)
