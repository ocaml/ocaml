These are informal notes on how to do an OCaml release.

Following these steps requires commit right in the OCaml repository,
as well as SSH access to the inria.fr file servers hosting the
distribution archives and manual.

We are not fully confident that those steps are correct, feel free to
check with other release managers in case of doubt.

Note: we say that a new release is a "testing release" if it is a Beta
version or Release Candidate. Otherwise, we call it a "production
release".


## A few days in advance

Send a mail on caml-devel to warn Gabriel (to make a pass on Changes)
and the OCamlLabs folks (for OPAM testing).

## 0: release environment setup

```
rm -f /tmp/env-$USER.sh
cat >/tmp/env-$USER.sh <<EOF

export WORKTREE=~/o/4.08
  # must be the git worktree for the branch you are releasing

export MAJOR=4
export MINOR=08
export BUGFIX=0
export PLUSEXT=+beta2

export BRANCH=\$MAJOR.\$MINOR
export VERSION=\$MAJOR.\$MINOR.\$BUGFIX\$PLUSEXT

export REPO=http://github.com/ocaml/ocaml

# these values are specific to caml.inria's host setup
# they are defined in the release manager's .bashrc file
export ARCHIVE_HOST="$OCAML_RELEASE_ARCHIVE_HOST"
export ARCHIVE_PATH="$OCAML_RELEASE_ARCHIVE_PATH"
export WEB_HOST="$OCAML_RELEASE_WEB_HOST"
export WEB_PATH="$OCAML_RELEASE_WEB_PATH"

export DIST=$ARCHIVE_PATH/ocaml/ocaml-\$MAJOR.\$MINOR
EOF
source /tmp/env-$USER.sh
echo $VERSION
```


## 1: check repository state

```
cd $WORKTREE
git status  # check that the local repo is in a clean state
git pull
```

## 2: magic numbers

If you are about to do a major release, you should check that the
magic numbers have been updated since the last major release. It is
preferable to do this just before the first testing release for this
major version, typically the first beta.

See the HACKING file of `utils/` for documentation on how to bump the
magic numbers.

## 3: build, refresh dependencies, sanity checks

```
make distclean
git clean -n -d -f -x  # Check that "make distclean" removed everything

INSTDIR=/tmp/ocaml-${VERSION}
rm -rf ${INSTDIR}
./configure -prefix ${INSTDIR}

make world.opt -j5
make alldepend
  # note: you have to run 'alldepend' after 'world',
  # not just after 'core' as before, because
  # ocamldoc/stdlib_non_prefixed depends on 'world'

# check that .depend files have no absolute path in them
find . -name .depend | xargs grep ' /'
  # must have empty output

make install
./tools/check-symbol-names runtime/*.a
  # must have empty output and return 0
```


## 4: tests

```
make tests
```


## 5: build, tag and push the new release

```
# at this point, the VERSION file contains N+devD
# increment it into N+dev(D+1); for example,
#   4.07.0+dev8-2018-06-19 => 4.07.0+dev9-2018-06-26
# for production releases: check and change the Changes header
#  (remove "next version" and add a date)
git add VERSION Changes
git commit -m "last commit before tagging $VERSION"
# update VERSION with the new release; for example,
#   4.07.0+dev9-2018-06-26 => 4.07.0+rc2
make coreboot -j5
make coreboot -j5 # must say "Fixpoint reached, bootstrap succeeded."
git commit -m "change VERSION for $VERSION" -a
git tag -m "release $VERSION" $VERSION

# for production releases, change the VERSION file into (N+1)+dev0; for example,
#   4.08.0 => 4.08.1+dev0
# for testing candidates, use N+dev(D+2) instead; for example,
#   4.07.0+rc2 => 4.07.0+dev10-2018-06-26
git commit -m "increment version number after tagging $VERSION" VERSION
git push
git push --tags
```


## 6: create OPAM switches

Create OPAM switches for the new version, copying the particular
switch configuration choices from the previous version.

We currently use a semi-automated process, copying and batch-editing
the compiler descriptions from the last release. The instructions
below assume an opam1 repository organization, an opam2 repository
will have a different layout.

From a branch of the opam-repository, in `compilers/$MAJOR.$MINOR.$BUGFIX`:

```
cd .../opam-repository/packages/ocaml-variants
# copy foo+rc2+... switches into foo+rc3+...
OLD_DIRS=*+rc2*
VER="s/+rc2/+rc3/g"

NEW_DIRS=""
for f in $OLD_DIRS; do NEW_DIRS="$NEW_DIRS $(echo $f | sed $VER)"; done
echo $NEW_DIRS # for checking

for f in $OLD_DIRS; do
    mkdir -p $(echo $f | sed $VER)
    for file in $f/*; do
      cp $file $(echo $file | sed $VER)
      # we copy the file, but their content still corresponds to the old version
    done
    git add $(echo $f | sed $VER)
done

git status
  # inspect the new filenames

for f in $NEW_DIRS; do sed -i $VER $f/*; done
git diff # inspect the result of this last change

git add $NEW_DIRS

# the strings below work on .descr files,
# they may need to be adapted
for f in $NEW_DIRS; do
  sed -i "s/rc2/rc3/g" $f/*
  sed -i "s/Second release candidate/Third release candidate/g" $f/*
done
git diff # inspect the result of this last change

git add $NEW_DIRS

git diff --cached # inspect the complete result

git commit -m "OPAM switches for $VERSION"
```

## 7: build the release archives

```
cd $WORKTREE
TMPDIR=/tmp/ocaml-release
git checkout $VERSION
git checkout-index -a -f --prefix=$TMPDIR/ocaml-$VERSION/
cd $TMPDIR
gtar -c --owner 0 --group 0 -f ocaml-$VERSION.tar ocaml-$VERSION
gzip -9 <ocaml-$VERSION.tar >ocaml-$VERSION.tar.gz
xz <ocaml-$VERSION.tar >ocaml-$VERSION.tar.xz
```


## 8: upload the archives and compute checksums

For the first beta of a major version, create the distribution directory on
the server:
```
ssh $ARCHIVE_HOST "mkdir -p $DIST"
```

Upload the archives:
```
scp ocaml-$VERSION.tar.{xz,gz} $ARCHIVE_HOST:$DIST
```

To update the checksum files on the remote host, we first upload the
release environment.
(note: this assumes the user name is the same on the two machines)

```
scp /tmp/env-$USER.sh $ARCHIVE_HOST:/tmp/env-$USER.sh
```

and then login there to update the checksums (MD5SUM, SHA512SUM)

```
ssh $ARCHIVE_HOST
source /tmp/env-$USER.sh
cd $DIST

cp MD5SUM MD5SUM.old
md5sum ocaml-$VERSION.tar.{xz,gz} > new-md5s
# check new-md5s to ensure that they look right, and then
cat new-md5s >> MD5SUM
# if everything worked well,
rm MD5SUM.old new-md5s

# same thing for SHA512
cp SHA512SUM SHA512SUM.old
sha512sum ocaml-$VERSION.tar.{xz,gz} > new-sha512s
cat new-sha512s >> SHA512SUM
rm SHA512SUM.old new-sha512s

# clean up
rm /tmp/env-$USER.sh
exit
```


## 9: update note files (technical documentation)

```
ssh $ARCHIVE_HOST "mkdir -p $DIST/notes"
cd ocaml-$VERSION
scp INSTALL.adoc LICENSE README.adoc README.win32.adoc Changes \
   $ARCHIVE_HOST:$DIST/notes/
```


## 10: upload the reference manual

You don't need to do this if the previous release had the same
$MAJOR.$MINOR ($BRANCH) value and the exact same manual -- this is frequent if
it was a release candidate.

```
cd $WORKTREE
make world.opt
make install
export PATH="$INSTDIR/bin:$PATH"
cd manual
make clean
make
rm -rf /tmp/release
mkdir -p /tmp/release
RELEASENAME="ocaml-$BRANCH-"
make -C manual release RELEASE=/tmp/release/$RELEASENAME
scp /tmp/release/* $ARCHIVE_HOST:$DIST/


# upload manual checksums
ssh $ARCHIVE_HOST "cd $DIST; md5sum ocaml-$BRANCH-refman* >>MD5SUM"
ssh $ARCHIVE_HOST "cd $DIST; sha512sum ocaml-$BRANCH-refman* >>SHA512SUM"
```

Releasing the manual online happens on another machine:
Do this ONLY FOR A PRODUCTION RELEASE

```
scp /tmp/env-$USER.sh $ARCHIVE_HOST:/tmp/env-$USER.sh
ssh $ARCHIVE_HOST
source /tmp/env-$USER.sh
scp /tmp/env-$USER.sh $WEB_HOST:/tmp
ssh $WEB_HOST
source /tmp/env-$USER.sh

cd $WEB_PATH/caml/pub/docs
mkdir -p manual-ocaml-$BRANCH
cd manual-ocaml-$BRANCH
wget http://caml.inria.fr/pub/distrib/ocaml-$BRANCH/ocaml-$BRANCH-refman-html.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ocaml-$BRANCH-refman-html.tar.gz # this extracts into htmlman/
cp -r htmlman/* . # move HTML content to docs/manual-caml-$BRANCH
rm -fR htmlman

cd $WEB_PATH/caml/pub/docs
ln -sf manual-ocaml-$BRANCH manual-ocaml
```


## 11: prepare web announce for the release

For production releases, you should get in touch with ocaml.org to
organize the webpage for the new release. See

  <https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/issues/819>


## 12: update Mantis

Update Mantis by adding $MAJOR.$MINOR.$BUGFIX as a version number for reports.

Provided you have a sufficient Mantis privilege level, this is done from

  https://caml.inria.fr/mantis/manage_proj_edit_page.php?project_id=1

after login, by scrolling down to "Versions".

(If you don't have the necessary Mantis rights, you need to ask
someone else to do this.)


## 13: announce the release on caml-list and caml-announce

See the email announce templates at the end of this file.
