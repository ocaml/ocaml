Welcome to OCaml's Issue tracker!

We welcome all suggestions for improvements to OCaml. It is helpful if
discussions on new features can initially begin on our community forums
(see https://discuss.ocaml.org and https://ocaml.org/community), mainly because
their readership is wider than this issue tracker, and you'll get better
feedback as to whether your suggestion is a good idea or has been considered
before. You may even end up with volunteers to help implement it!

It is often easier to propose changes to the language than it is to design those
changes: if you are proposing an alteration to the language, please be aware
that we may need to have a more complete proposal of how the change will be
implemented than "It would be nice to be able to X in OCaml" (see also
https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs)
