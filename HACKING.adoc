= Hacking the compiler :camel:

This document is a work-in-progress attempt to provide useful
information for people willing to inspect or modify the compiler
distribution's codebase. Feel free to improve it by sending change
proposals for it.

If you already have a patch that you would like to contribute to the
official distribution, please see link:CONTRIBUTING.md[].

=== Your first compiler modification

1. Create a new git branch to store your changes.
+
----
git checkout -b my-modification
----

2. Consult link:INSTALL.adoc[] for build instructions. Here is the gist of it:
+
----
./configure
make world.opt
----

3. Try the newly built compiler binaries `ocamlc`, `ocamlopt` or their
`.opt` version. To try the toplevel, use:
+
----
make runtop
----

4. Hack frenetically and keep rebuilding.

5. Run the testsuite from time to time.
+
----
make tests
----

5. Install in a new opam switch to try things out:
+
----
opam compiler-conf install
----
+
With opam 2, create a local opam switch with the compiler installed from
the current source directory:
+
----
opam switch create . --empty
opam install .
----

6. You did it, Well done! Consult link:CONTRIBUTING.md[] to send your contribution upstream.

See our <<Development tips and tricks>> for various helpful details,
for example on how to automatically <<opam compiler script,create an
opam switch>> from a compiler branch.

=== What to do

There is always a lot of potential tasks, both for old and
newcomers. Here are various potential projects:

* http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view_all_bug_page.php[The OCaml
  bugtracker] contains reported bugs and feature requests. Some
  changes that should be accessible to newcomers are marked with the
  tag link:++http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/search.php?
project_id=1&sticky_issues=1&sortby=last_updated&dir=DESC&highlight_changed=24&hide_status_id=90&tag_string=junior_job++[
  junior_job].

* The
  https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on[OCaml
  Labs compiler-hacking wiki] contains various ideas of changes to
  propose, some easy, some requiring a fair amount of work.

* Documentation improvements are always much appreciated, either in
  the various `.mli` files or in the official manual
  (See link:manual/README.md[]). If you invest effort in understanding
  a part of the codebase, submitting a pull request that adds
  clarifying comments can be an excellent contribution to help you,
  next time, and other code readers.

* The https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml[github project] contains a lot of
  pull requests, many of them being in dire need of a review -- we
  have more people willing to contribute changes than to review
  someone else's change. Picking one of them, trying to understand the
  code (looking at the code around it) and asking questions about what
  you don't understand or what feels odd is super-useful. It helps the
  contribution process, and it is also an excellent way to get to know
  various parts of the compiler from the angle of a specific aspect or
  feature.
+
Again, reviewing small or medium-sized pull requests is accessible to
anyone with OCaml programming experience, and helps maintainers and
other contributors. If you also submit pull requests yourself, a good
discipline is to review at least as many pull requests as you submit.

== Structure of the compiler

The compiler codebase can be intimidating at first sight. Here are
a few pointers to get started.

=== Compilation pipeline

==== The driver -- link:driver/[]

The driver contains the "main" function of the compilers that drive
compilation. It parses the command-line arguments and composes the
required compiler passes by calling functions from the various parts
of the compiler described below.

==== Parsing -- link:parsing/[]

Parses source files and produces an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
(link:parsing/parsetree.mli[] has lot of helpful comments). See
link:parsing/HACKING.adoc[].

The logic for Camlp4 and Ppx preprocessing is not in link:parsing/[],
but in link:driver/[], see link:driver/pparse.mli[] and
link:driver/pparse.ml[].

==== Typing -- link:typing/[]

Type-checks the AST and produces a typed representation of the program
(link:typing/typedtree.mli[] has some helpful comments). See
link:typing/HACKING.adoc[].

==== The bytecode compiler -- link:bytecomp/[]

==== The native compiler -- link:middle_end/[] and link:asmcomp/[]

=== Runtime system

=== Libraries

link:stdlib/[]:: The standard library. Each file is largely
independent and should not need further knowledge.

link:otherlibs/[]:: External libraries such as `unix`, `threads`,
`dynlink`, `str` and `bigarray`.

Instructions for building the full reference manual are provided in
link:manual/README.md[]. However, if you only modify the documentation
comments in `.mli` files in the compiler codebase, you can observe the
result by running

----
make html_doc
----

and then opening link:./ocamldoc/stdlib_html/index.html[] in a web browser.

=== Tools

link:lex/[]:: The `ocamllex` lexer generator.

link:yacc/[]:: The `ocamlyacc` parser generator. We do not recommend
using it for user projects in need of a parser generator. Please
consider using and contributing to
link:http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/[menhir] instead, which
has tons of extra features, lets you write more readable grammars, and
has excellent documentation.

== Development tips and tricks

=== opam compiler script

The separately-distributed script
https://github.com/gasche/opam-compiler-conf[`opam-compiler-conf`] can
be used to easily build opam switches out of a git branch of the
compiler distribution. This lets you easily install and test opam
packages from an under-modification compiler version.

=== Useful Makefile targets

Besides the targets listed in link:INSTALL.adoc[] for build and
installation, the following targets may be of use:

`make runtop` :: builds and runs the ocaml toplevel of the distribution
                          (optionally uses `rlwrap` for readline+history support)
`make natruntop`:: builds and runs the native ocaml toplevel (experimental)

`make partialclean`:: Clean the OCaml files but keep the compiled C files.

`make depend`:: Regenerate the `.depend` file. Should be used each time new dependencies are added between files.

`make -C testsuite parallel`:: see link:testsuite/HACKING.adoc[]

Additionally, there are some developer specific targets in link:Makefile.dev[].
These targets are automatically available when working in a Git clone of the
repository, but are not available from a tarball.

=== Bootstrapping

The OCaml compiler is bootstrapped. This means that
previously-compiled bytecode versions of the compiler and lexer are
included in the repository under the
link:boot/[] directory. These bytecode images are used once the
bytecode runtime (which is written in C) has been built to compile the
standard library and then to build a fresh compiler. Details can be
found in link:BOOTSTRAP.adoc[].

=== Speeding up builds

Once you've built a natively-compiled `ocamlc.opt`, you can use it to
speed up future builds by copying it to `boot`:

----
cp ocamlc.opt boot/
----

If `boot/ocamlc` changes (e.g. because you ran `make bootstrap`), then
the build will revert to the slower bytecode-compiled `ocamlc` until
you do the above step again.

=== Continuous integration

==== Github's CI: Travis and AppVeyor

The script that is run on Travis continuous integration servers is
link:tools/ci/travis/travis-ci.sh[]; its configuration can be found as
a Travis configuration file in link:.travis.yml[].

For example, if you want to reproduce the default build on your
machine, you can use the configuration values and run command taken from
link:.travis.yml[]:

----
CI_KIND=build XARCH=x64 bash -ex tools/ci/travis/travis-ci.sh
----

The scripts support two other kinds of tests (values of the
`CI_KIND` variable) which both inspect the patch submitted as part of
a pull request. `tests` checks that the testsuite has been modified
(hopefully, improved) by the patch, and `changes` checks that the
link:Changes[] file has been modified (hopefully to add a new entry).

These tests rely on the `$TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE` variable which you can
set explicitly to reproduce them locally.

The `changes` check can be disabled by including "(no change
entry needed)" in one of your commit messages -- but in general all
patches submitted should come with a Changes entry; see the guidelines
in link:CONTRIBUTING.md[].

==== INRIA's Continuous Integration (CI)

INRIA provides a Jenkins continuous integration service that OCaml
uses, see link:https://ci.inria.fr/ocaml/[]. It provides a wider
architecture support (MSVC and MinGW, a zsystems s390x machine, and
various MacOS versions) than the Travis/AppVeyor testing on github,
but only runs on commits to the trunk or release branches, not on every
PR.

You do not need to be an INRIA employee to open an account on this
jenkins service; anyone can create an account there to access build
logs and manually restart builds. If you
would like to do this but have trouble doing it, please email
ocaml-ci-admin@inria.fr.

To be notified by email of build failures, you can subscribe to the
ocaml-ci-notifications@inria.fr mailing list by visiting
https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/info/ocaml-ci-notifications[its web page.]

==== Running INRIA's CI on a publicly available git branch

If you have suspicions that your changes may fail on exotic architectures
(they touch the build system or the backend code generator,
for example) and would like to get wider testing than github's CI
provides, it is possible to manually start INRIA's CI on arbitrary git
branches even before opening a pull request as follows:

1. Make sure you have an account on Inria's CI as described before.

2. Make sure you have been added to the ocaml project.

3. Prepare a branch with the code you'd like to test, say "mybranch". It
is probably a good idea to make sure your branch is based on the latest
trunk.

4. Make your branch publicly available. For instance, you can fork
OCaml's GitHub repository and then push "mybranch" to your fork.

5. Visit https://ci.inria.fr/ocaml/job/precheck and log in. Click on
"Build with parameters".

6. Fill in the REPO_URL and BRANCH fields as appropriate and run the build.

7. You should receive a bunch of e-mails with the build logs for each
slave and each tested configuration (with and without flambda) attached.

==== Changing what the CI does

INRIA's CI "main" and "precheck" jobs run the script
tools/ci-build. In particular, when running the CI on a publicly
available branch via the "precheck" job as explained in the previous
section, you can edit this script to change what the CI will test.

For instance, parallel builds are only tested for the "trunk"
branch. In order to use "precheck" to test parallel build on a custom
branch, add this at the beginning of tools/ci-build:

----
OCAML_JOBS=10
----

=== The `caml-commits` mailing list

If you would like to receive email notifications of all commits made to the main
git repository, you can subscribe to the caml-commits@inria.fr mailing list by
visiting https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/info/caml-commits[its web page.]

Happy Hacking!
