(** {0 Parametric diffing}

    This module implements diffing over lists of arbitrary content.
    It is parameterized by
    - The content of the two lists
    - The equality witness when an element is kept
    - The diffing witness when an element is changed

    Diffing is extended to maintain state depending on the
    computed changes while walking through the two lists.

    The underlying algorithm is a modified Wagner-Fischer algorithm
    (see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm>).

    We provide the following guarantee:
    Given two lists [l] and [r], if different patches result in different
    states, we say that the state diverges.
    - We always return the optimal patch on prefixes of [l] and [r]
      on which state does not diverge.
    - Otherwise, we return a correct but non-optimal patch where subpatches
      with no divergent states are optimal for the given initial state.

    More precisely, the optimality of Wagner-Fischer depends on the property
    that the edit-distance between a k-prefix of the left input and a l-prefix
    of the right input d(k,l) satisfies

    d(k,l) = min (
     del_cost + d(k-1,l),
     insert_cost + d(k,l-1),
     change_cost + d(k-1,l-1)
    )

   Under this hypothesis, it is optimal to choose greedily the state of the
   minimal patch transforming the left k-prefix into the right l-prefix as a
   representative of the states of all possible patches transforming the left
   k-prefix into the right l-prefix.

   If this property is not satisfied, we can still choose greedily a
   representative state. However, the computed patch is no more guaranteed to
   be globally optimal.
   Nevertheless, it is still a correct patch, which is even optimal among all
   explored patches.
