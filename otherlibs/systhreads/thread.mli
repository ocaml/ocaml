(** Lightweight threads for Posix [1003.1c] and Win32. *)

type t
(** The type of thread handles. *)

(** {1 Thread creation and termination} *)

val create : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> t
(** [Thread.create funct arg] creates a new thread of control,
   in which the function application [funct arg]
   is executed concurrently with the other threads of the program.
   The application of [Thread.create]
   returns the handle of the newly created thread.
   The new thread terminates when the application [funct arg]
   returns, either normally or by raising an uncaught exception.
   In the latter case, the exception is printed on standard error,
   but not propagated back to the parent thread. Similarly, the
   result of the application [funct arg] is discarded and not
   directly accessible to the parent thread. *)

val self : unit -> t
(** Return the thread currently executing. *)

val id : t -> int
(** Return the identifier of the given thread. A thread identifier
   is an integer that identifies uniquely the thread.
   It can be used to build data structures indexed by threads. *)

val exit : unit -> unit
(** Terminate prematurely the currently executing thread. *)

val kill : t -> unit
(** Terminate prematurely the thread whose handle is given. *)

(** {1 Suspending threads} *)

val delay: float -> unit
(** [delay d] suspends the execution of the calling thread for
   [d] seconds. The other program threads continue to run during
   this time. *)

val join : t -> unit
(** [join th] suspends the execution of the calling thread
   until the thread [th] has terminated. *)

val wait_read : Unix.file_descr -> unit
(** See {!Thread.wait_write}.*)

val wait_write : Unix.file_descr -> unit
(** This function does nothing in this implementation. *)

val wait_timed_read : Unix.file_descr -> float -> bool
(** See {!Thread.wait_timed_write}.*)

val wait_timed_write : Unix.file_descr -> float -> bool
(** Suspend the execution of the calling thread until at least
   one character or EOF is available for reading ([wait_read]) or
   one character can be written without blocking ([wait_write])
   on the given Unix file descriptor. Wait for at most
   the amount of time given as second argument (in seconds).
   Return [true] if the file descriptor is ready for input/output
   and [false] if the timeout expired.

   These functions return immediately [true] in the Win32
   implementation. *)

val select :
  Unix.file_descr list -> Unix.file_descr list ->
  Unix.file_descr list -> float ->
    Unix.file_descr list * Unix.file_descr list * Unix.file_descr list
(** Suspend the execution of the calling thread until input/output
   becomes possible on the given Unix file descriptors.
   The arguments and results have the same meaning as for
   [Unix.select].
   This function is not implemented yet under Win32. *)

val wait_pid : int -> int * Unix.process_status
(** [wait_pid p] suspends the execution of the calling thread
   until the process specified by the process identifier [p]
   terminates. Returns the pid of the child caught and
   its termination status, as per [Unix.wait].
   This function is not implemented under MacOS. *)

val yield : unit -> unit
(** Re-schedule the calling thread without suspending it.
   This function can be used to give scheduling hints,
   telling the scheduler that now is a good time to
   switch to other threads. *)

(** {1 Management of signals} *)

(** Signal handling follows the POSIX thread model: signals generated
  by a thread are delivered to that thread; signals generated externally
  are delivered to one of the threads that does not block it.
  Each thread possesses a set of blocked signals, which can be modified
  using {!Thread.sigmask}.  This set is inherited at thread creation time.
  Per-thread signal masks are supported only by the system thread library
  under Unix, but not under Win32, nor by the VM thread library. *)

val sigmask : Unix.sigprocmask_command -> int list -> int list
(** [sigmask cmd sigs] changes the set of blocked signals for the
   calling thread.
   If [cmd] is [SIG_SETMASK], blocked signals are set to those in
   the list [sigs].
   If [cmd] is [SIG_BLOCK], the signals in [sigs] are added to
   the set of blocked signals.
   If [cmd] is [SIG_UNBLOCK], the signals in [sigs] are removed
   from the set of blocked signals.
   [sigmask] returns the set of previously blocked signals for the thread. *)


val wait_signal : int list -> int
(** [wait_signal sigs] suspends the execution of the calling thread
   until the process receives one of the signals specified in the
   list [sigs].  It then returns the number of the signal received.
   Signal handlers attached to the signals in [sigs] will not
   be invoked.  The signals [sigs] are expected to be blocked before
   calling [wait_signal]. *)
