(** Locks for mutual exclusion.

   Mutexes (mutual-exclusion locks) are used to implement critical sections
   and protect shared mutable data structures against concurrent accesses.
   The typical use is (if [m] is the mutex associated with the data structure
   [D]):
   {[
     Mutex.lock m;
     (* Critical section that operates over D *);
     Mutex.unlock m
   ]}
*)

type t
(** The type of mutexes. *)

val create : unit -> t
(** Return a new mutex. *)

val lock : t -> unit
(** Lock the given mutex. Only one thread can have the mutex locked
   at any time. A thread that attempts to lock a mutex already locked
   by another thread will suspend until the other thread unlocks
   the mutex.

   @raise Sys_error if the mutex is already locked by the thread calling
   {!Mutex.lock}.

   @before 4.12 {!Sys_error} was not raised for recursive locking
   (platform-dependent behaviour) *)

val try_lock : t -> bool
(** Same as {!Mutex.lock}, but does not suspend the calling thread if
   the mutex is already locked: just return [false] immediately
   in that case. If the mutex is unlocked, lock it and
   return [true]. *)

val unlock : t -> unit
(** Unlock the given mutex. Other threads suspended trying to lock
   the mutex will restart.  The mutex must have been previously locked
   by the thread that calls {!Mutex.unlock}.
   @raise Sys_error if the mutex is unlocked or was locked by another thread.

   @before 4.12 {!Sys_error} was not raised when unlocking an unlocked mutex
   or when unlocking a mutex from a different thread. *)
