   special privileges.

   (This function is identical to {!Sys.getenv}. *)

(*
val unsafe_getenv : string -> string
(** Return the value associated to a variable in the process
   environment.

   Unlike {!getenv}, this function returns the value even if the
   process has special privileges. It is considered unsafe because the
   programmer of a setuid or setgid program must be careful to avoid
   using maliciously crafted environment variables in the search path
   for executables, the locations for temporary files or logs, and the
   like.

   @raise Not_found if the variable is unbound.  *)
*)

val putenv : string -> string -> unit
(** [Unix.putenv name value] sets the value associated to a
   variable in the process environment.
   [name] is the name of the environment variable,
   and [value] its new associated value. *)

        (** The process was stopped by a signal; the argument is the
           signal number. *)

val fork : unit -> int
(** Fork a new process. The returned integer is 0 for the child
   process, the pid of the child process for the parent process.

   On Windows: not implemented, use {!create_process} or threads. *)

val wait : unit -> int * process_status
(** Wait until one of the children processes die, and return its pid
   and termination status.

   On Windows: Not implemented, use {!waitpid}. *)

val waitpid : wait_flag list -> int -> int * process_status
(** Same as {!Unix.wait}, but waits for the child process whose pid is given.
   A pid of [-1] means wait for any child.
   A pid of [0] means wait for any child in the same process group
   as the current process.
   Negative pid arguments represent process groups.
   The list of options indicates whether [waitpid] should return
   immediately without waiting, and whether it should report stopped
   children.

   On Windows, this function can only wait for a given PID, not any
   child process. *)

val system : string -> process_status
(** Execute the given command, wait until it terminates, and return
   its termination status. The string is interpreted by the shell
   [/bin/sh] (or the command interpreter [cmd.exe] on Windows) and
   therefore can contain redirections, quotes, variables, etc. The
   result [WEXITED 127] indicates that the shell couldn't be
   executed. *)

val getpid : unit -> int
(** Return the pid of the process. *)

val getppid : unit -> int
(** Return the pid of the parent process.
   On Windows: not implemented (because it is meaningless). *)

val nice : int -> int
(** Change the process priority. The integer argument is added to the
   ``nice'' value. (Higher values of the ``nice'' value mean
   lower priorities.) Return the new nice value.

   On Windows: not implemented. *)

   On Windows, [set_binary_mode_in] always fails on channels created
   with this function.

   Beware that channels are buffered so more characters may have been
   read from the file descriptor than those accessed using channel functions.
   Channels also keep a copy of the current position in the file.

   You need to explicitly close all channels created with this function.
   Closing the channel also closes the underlying file descriptor (unless
   it was already closed). *)

val out_channel_of_descr : file_descr -> out_channel
(** Create an output channel writing on the given descriptor.
   The channel is initially in binary mode; use
   [set_binary_mode_out oc false] if text mode is desired.
   Text mode is supported only if the descriptor refers to a file
   or pipe, but is not supported if it refers to a socket.
   On Windows, [set_binary_mode_out] always fails on channels created
   with this function.

   Beware that channels are buffered so you may have to [flush] them
   to ensure that all data has been sent to the file descriptor.
   Channels also keep a copy of the current position in the file.

   You need to explicitly close all channels created with this function.
   Closing the channel flushes the data and closes the underlying file
   descriptor (unless it has already been closed, in which case the
   buffered data is lost).*)

val dup : ?cloexec:bool -> file_descr -> file_descr

   optional argument. *)

(** [dup2 fd1 fd2] duplicates [fd1] to [fd2], closing [fd2] if already
   opened.
   See {!set_close_on_exec} for documentation on the [cloexec]
   optional argument. *)

val set_nonblock : file_descr -> unit
(** Set the ``non-blocking'' flag on the given descriptor.
   When the non-blocking flag is set, reading on a descriptor
   on which there is temporarily no data available raises the
   [EAGAIN] or [EWOULDBLOCK] error instead of blocking;
   writing on a descriptor on which there is temporarily no room
   for writing also raises [EAGAIN] or [EWOULDBLOCK]. *)

val clear_nonblock : file_descr -> unit
(** Clear the ``non-blocking'' flag on the given descriptor.
   See {!Unix.set_nonblock}.*)

val set_close_on_exec : file_descr -> unit
(** Set the ``close-on-exec'' flag on the given descriptor.
   A descriptor with the close-on-exec flag is automatically
   closed when the current process starts another program with
   one of the [exec], [create_process] and [open_process] functions.

   It is often a security hole to leak file descriptors opened on, say,
   a private file to an external program: the program, then, gets access
   to the private file and can do bad things with it.  Hence, it is
   highly recommended to set all file descriptors ``close-on-exec'',
   except in the very few cases where a file descriptor actually needs
   to be transmitted to another program.  

   The best way to set a file descriptor ``close-on-exec'' is to create
   it in this state.  To this end, the [openfile] function has
   [O_CLOEXEC] and [O_KEEPEXEC] flags to enforce ``close-on-exec'' mode
   or ``keep-on-exec'' mode, respectively.  All other operations in
   the Unix module that create file descriptors have an optional
   argument [?cloexec:bool] to indicate whether the file descriptor
   should be created in ``close-on-exec'' mode (by writing
   [~cloexec:true]) or in ``keep-on-exec'' mode (by writing
   [~cloexec:false]).  For historical reasons, the default file
   descriptor creation mode is ``keep-on-exec'', if no [cloexec] optional
   argument is given.  This is not a safe default, hence it is highly
   recommended to pass explicit [cloexec] arguments to operations that
   create file descriptors.

   The [cloexec] optional arguments and the [O_KEEPEXEC] flag were introduced
   in OCaml 4.05.  Earlier, the common practice was to create file descriptors
   in the default, ``keep-on-exec'' mode, then call [set_close_on_exec]
   on those freshly-created file descriptors.  This is not as safe as
   creating the file descriptor in ``close-on-exec'' mode because, in
   multithreaded programs, a window of vulnerability exists between the time
   when the file descriptor is created and the time [set_close_on_exec]
   completes.  If another thread spawns another program during this window,
   the descriptor will leak, as it is still in the ``keep-on-exec'' mode.

   Regarding the atomicity guarantees given by [~cloexec:true] or by
   the use of the [O_CLOEXEC] flag: on all platforms it is guaranteed
   that a concurrently-executing Caml thread cannot leak the descriptor
   by starting a new process.  On Linux, this guarantee extends to
   concurrently-executing C threads.  As of Feb 2017, other operating
   systems lack the necessary system calls and still expose a window
   of vulnerability during which a C thread can see the newly-created
   file descriptor in ``keep-on-exec'' mode.

   forks a new process that executes the program
   in file [prog], with arguments [args]. The pid of the new
   process is returned immediately; the new process executes
   concurrently with the current process.
   The standard input and outputs of the new process are connected
   to the descriptors [new_stdin], [new_stdout] and [new_stderr].
   Passing e.g. [stdout] for [new_stdout] prevents the redirection
   and causes the new process to have the same standard output
   as the current process.

   correct synchronization. *)

val open_process : string -> in_channel * out_channel
(** Same as {!Unix.open_process_out}, but redirects both the standard input
   and standard output of the command to pipes connected to the two

   of the command, and the output channel to the input of the command. *)

val open_process_full :

   and standard error of the command. *)

val close_process_in : in_channel -> process_status
(** Close channels opened by {!Unix.open_process_in},

(** {6 Symbolic links} *)


val symlink : ?to_dir:bool -> string -> string -> unit
(** [symlink ?to_dir source dest] creates the file [dest] as a symbolic link
   to the file [source]. On Windows, [~to_dir] indicates if the symbolic link
   points to a directory or a file; if omitted, [symlink] examines [source]
   using [stat] and picks appropriately, if [source] does not exist then [false]
   is assumed (for this reason, it is recommended that the [~to_dir] parameter
   be specified in new code). On Unix, [~to_dir] is ignored.

   Windows symbolic links are available in Windows Vista onwards. There are some
   important differences between Windows symlinks and their POSIX counterparts.

   Windows symbolic links come in two flavours: directory and regular, which
   designate whether the symbolic link points to a directory or a file. The type
   must be correct - a directory symlink which actually points to a file cannot
   be selected with chdir and a file symlink which actually points to a
   directory cannot be read or written (note that Cygwin's emulation layer
   ignores this distinction).

   When symbolic links are created to existing targets, this distinction doesn't
   matter and [symlink] will automatically create the correct kind of symbolic
   link. The distinction matters when a symbolic link is created to a
   non-existent target.

   The other caveat is that by default symbolic links are a privileged
   operation. Administrators will always need to be running elevated (or with
   UAC disabled) and by default normal user accounts need to be granted the
   SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege via Local Security Policy (secpol.msc) or via
   Active Directory.

   {!has_symlink} can be used to check that a process is able to create symbolic
   links. *)

val has_symlink : unit -> bool
(** Returns [true] if the user is able to create symbolic links. On Windows,
   this indicates that the user not only has the SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege

(** {6 Locking} *)

  | F_TLOCK       (** Lock a region for writing, or fail if already locked *)
  | F_TEST        (** Test a region for other process locks *)
  | F_RLOCK       (** Lock a region for reading, and block if already locked *)
  | F_TRLOCK      (** Lock a region for reading, or fail if already locked *)
(** Commands for {!Unix.lockf}. *)

val lockf : file_descr -> lock_command -> int -> unit
(** [lockf fd cmd size] puts a lock on a region of the file opened
   as [fd]. The region starts at the current read/write position for
   [fd] (as set by {!Unix.lseek}), and extends [size] bytes forward if
   [size] is positive, [size] bytes backwards if [size] is negative,
   or to the end of the file if [size] is zero.
   A write lock prevents any other
   process from acquiring a read or write lock on the region.
   A read lock prevents any other
   process from acquiring a write lock on the region, but lets
   other processes acquire read locks on it.

   The [F_LOCK] and [F_TLOCK] commands attempts to put a write lock
   on the specified region.
   The [F_RLOCK] and [F_TRLOCK] commands attempts to put a read lock
   on the specified region.
   If one or several locks put by another process prevent the current process
   from acquiring the lock, [F_LOCK] and [F_RLOCK] block until these locks
   are removed, while [F_TLOCK] and [F_TRLOCK] fail immediately with an
   exception.
   The [F_ULOCK] removes whatever locks the current process has on
   the specified region.
   Finally, the [F_TEST] command tests whether a write lock can be
   acquired on the specified region, without actually putting a lock.
   It returns immediately if successful, or fails otherwise.

   What happens when a process tries to lock a region of a file that is
   already locked by the same process depends on the OS.  On POSIX-compliant
   systems, the second lock operation succeeds and may "promote" the older
   lock from read lock to write lock.  On Windows, the second lock
   operation will block or fail.
