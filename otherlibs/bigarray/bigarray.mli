(** Large, multi-dimensional, numerical arrays.

   This module implements multi-dimensional arrays of integers and
   floating-point numbers, thereafter referred to as 'big arrays'.
   The implementation allows efficient sharing of large numerical
   arrays between OCaml code and C or Fortran numerical libraries.

   Concerning the naming conventions, users of this module are encouraged
   to do [open Bigarray] in their source, then refer to array types and
   operations via short dot notation, e.g. [Array1.t] or [Array2.sub].

   Big arrays support all the OCaml ad-hoc polymorphic operations:
   - comparisons ([=], [<>], [<=], etc, as well as {!Pervasives.compare});
   - hashing (module [Hash]);
   - and structured input-output (the functions from the
     {!Marshal} module, as well as {!Pervasives.output_value}
     and {!Pervasives.input_value}).
*)

(** {6 Element kinds} *)

(** Big arrays can contain elements of the following kinds:
- IEEE single precision (32 bits) floating-point numbers
   ({!Bigarray.float32_elt}),
- IEEE double precision (64 bits) floating-point numbers
   ({!Bigarray.float64_elt}),
- IEEE single precision (2 * 32 bits) floating-point complex numbers
   ({!Bigarray.complex32_elt}),
- IEEE double precision (2 * 64 bits) floating-point complex numbers
   ({!Bigarray.complex64_elt}),
- 8-bit integers (signed or unsigned)
   ({!Bigarray.int8_signed_elt} or {!Bigarray.int8_unsigned_elt}),
- 16-bit integers (signed or unsigned)
   ({!Bigarray.int16_signed_elt} or {!Bigarray.int16_unsigned_elt}),
- OCaml integers (signed, 31 bits on 32-bit architectures,
   63 bits on 64-bit architectures) ({!Bigarray.int_elt}),
- 32-bit signed integer ({!Bigarray.int32_elt}),
- 64-bit signed integers ({!Bigarray.int64_elt}),
- platform-native signed integers (32 bits on 32-bit architectures,
   64 bits on 64-bit architectures) ({!Bigarray.nativeint_elt}).

   Each element kind is represented at the type level by one of the
   [*_elt] types defined below (defined with a single constructor instead
   of abstract types for technical injectivity reasons).
*)

  | Char : (char, int8_unsigned_elt) kind (**)
(** To each element kind is associated an OCaml type, which is
   the type of OCaml values that can be stored in the big array
   or read back from it.  This type is not necessarily the same
   as the type of the array elements proper: for instance,
   a big array whose elements are of kind [float32_elt] contains
   32-bit single precision floats, but reading or writing one of
   its elements from OCaml uses the OCaml type [float], which is
   64-bit double precision floats.

   The GADT type [('a, 'b) kind] captures this association
   of an OCaml type ['a] for values read or written in the big array,
   and of an element kind ['b] which represents the actual contents
   of the big array. Its constructors list all possible associations
   of OCaml types with element kinds, and are re-exported below for
   backward-compatibility reasons.

   Using a generalized algebraic datatype (GADT) here allows to write
   well-typed polymorphic functions whose return type depend on the
   argument type, such as:

{[
  let zero : type a b. (a, b) kind -> a = function
    | Float32 -> 0.0 | Complex32 -> Complex.zero
    | Float64 -> 0.0 | Complex64 -> Complex.zero
    | Int8_signed -> 0 | Int8_unsigned -> 0
    | Int16_signed -> 0 | Int16_unsigned -> 0
    | Int32 -> 0l | Int64 -> 0L
    | Int -> 0 | Nativeint -> 0n
    | Char -> '\000'
]}

   [complex32_elt], [complex64_elt] are accessed with the OCaml type
   {!Complex.t}. Big arrays of
   integer kinds are accessed using the smallest OCaml integer
   type large enough to represent the array elements:
   [int] for 8- and 16-bit integer bigarrays, as well as OCaml-integer
   bigarrays; [int32] for 32-bit integer bigarrays; [int64]
   for 64-bit integer bigarrays; and [nativeint] for
   platform-native integer bigarrays.  Finally, big arrays of
   kind [int8_unsigned_elt] can also be accessed as arrays of
   characters instead of arrays of small integers, by using
   the kind value [char] instead of [int8_unsigned]. *)

(** To facilitate interoperability with existing C and Fortran code,
   this library supports two different memory layouts for big arrays,
   one compatible with the C conventions,
   the other compatible with the Fortran conventions.

   In the C-style layout, array indices start at 0, and
   multi-dimensional arrays are laid out in row-major format.
   That is, for a two-dimensional array, all elements of
   row 0 are contiguous in memory, followed by all elements of
   row 1, etc.  In other terms, the array elements at [(x,y)]
   and [(x, y+1)] are adjacent in memory.

   In the Fortran-style layout, array indices start at 1, and
   multi-dimensional arrays are laid out in column-major format.
   That is, for a two-dimensional array, all elements of
   column 0 are contiguous in memory, followed by all elements of
   column 1, etc.  In other terms, the array elements at [(x,y)]
   and [(x+1, y)] are adjacent in memory.

   Each layout style is identified at the type level by the
   phantom types {!Bigarray.c_layout} and {!Bigarray.fortran_layout}
   respectively. *)

(** {7 Supported layouts}

   The GADT type ['a layout] represents one of the two supported
   memory layouts: C-style or Fortran-style. Its constructors are
   re-exported as values below for backward-compatibility reasons.

(** {6 Generic arrays (of arbitrarily many dimensions)} *)

module Genarray :
  sig
  type ('a, 'b, 'c) t
  (** The type [Genarray.t] is the type of big arrays with variable
     numbers of dimensions.  Any number of dimensions between 0 and 16
     is supported.

     The three type parameters to [Genarray.t] identify the array element
     kind and layout, as follows:
     - the first parameter, ['a], is the OCaml type for accessing array
       elements ([float], [int], [int32], [int64], [nativeint]);
     - the second parameter, ['b], is the actual kind of array elements
       ([float32_elt], [float64_elt], [int8_signed_elt], [int8_unsigned_elt],
       etc);
     - the third parameter, ['c], identifies the array layout
       ([c_layout] or [fortran_layout]).

     For instance, [(float, float32_elt, fortran_layout) Genarray.t]
     is the type of generic big arrays containing 32-bit floats
     in Fortran layout; reads and writes in this array use the
     OCaml type [float]. *)

     determined by the parameter [layout] (one of [c_layout] or
     [fortran_layout]).  The [dimensions] parameter is an array of
     integers that indicate the size of the big array in each dimension.
     The length of [dimensions] determines the number of dimensions
     of the bigarray.

     For instance, [Genarray.create int32 c_layout [|4;6;8|]]
     returns a fresh big array of 32-bit integers, in C layout,
     having three dimensions, the three dimensions being 4, 6 and 8

     [Genarray.map_file fd kind layout shared dims]
     returns a big array of kind [kind], layout [layout],
     and dimensions as specified in [dims].  The data contained in
     this big array are the contents of the file referred to by
     the file descriptor [fd] (as opened previously with
     [Unix.openfile], for example).  The optional [pos] parameter
     is the byte offset in the file of the data being mapped;
     it defaults to 0 (map from the beginning of the file).

     If [shared] is [true], all modifications performed on the array
     are reflected in the file.  This requires that [fd] be opened
     with write permissions.  If [shared] is [false], modifications
     performed on the array are done in memory only, using
     copy-on-write of the modified pages; the underlying file is not
     affected.

     [Genarray.map_file] is much more efficient than reading
     the whole file in a big array, modifying that big array,
     and writing it afterwards.

     To adjust automatically the dimensions of the big array to
     the actual size of the file, the major dimension (that is,
     the first dimension for an array with C layout, and the last
     dimension for an array with Fortran layout) can be given as
     [-1].  [Genarray.map_file] then determines the major dimension
     from the size of the file.  The file must contain an integral
     number of sub-arrays as determined by the non-major dimensions,
     otherwise [Failure] is raised.

     If all dimensions of the big array are given, the file size is
     matched against the size of the big array.  If the file is larger
     than the big array, only the initial portion of the file is
     mapped to the big array.  If the file is smaller than the big
     array, the file is automatically grown to the size of the big array.
     This requires write permissions on [fd].

     Array accesses are bounds-checked, but the bounds are determined by
     the initial call to [map_file]. Therefore, you should make sure no
     other process modifies the mapped file while you're accessing it,
     or a SIGBUS signal may be raised. This happens, for instance, if the
     file is shrunk.

     This function raises [Sys_error] in the case of any errors from the
     underlying system calls.  [Invalid_argument] or [Failure] may be
     raised in cases where argument validation fails. *)
