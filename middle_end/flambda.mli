   name changes (e.g. "closure -> set_of_closures"). *)
(** Intermediate language used to perform closure conversion and inlining.

    Closure conversion starts with [Lambda] code.  The conversion transforms
    function declarations into "sets of closures" ([Set_of_closures]
    constructor) in the [Flambda] language.

    The usual case of a function declared on its own will produce a
    [Set_of_closures] containing a single closure.  The closure itself may
    be accessed using [Project_closure] and specifies which variables (by name, not
    by any numeric offset) are free in the corresponding function definition.
    Occurrences of these free variables in the body appear as the usual
    [Var] expressions.

    For the case of multiple functions defined together, possibly mutually
    recursive, a [Set_of_closures] value will be generated containing
    one closure per function.  Each closure may be accessed again using
    [Project_closure], specifying which function's closure is desired.

    As an example, the flambda representation of:

      {[let rec f x = ...
        and g x = ... ]}

    might be (for identifiers [f] and [g] corresponding to the variables of
    the same name in the source text):

      {[Let( closure, Set_of_closures { id_f -> ...; id_g -> ... },
              Let(f, Project_closure { closure = closure; closure_id = id_f },
              Let(g, Project_closure { closure = closure; closure_id = id_g },
              ...)))]}

    One can also use [Project_closure] to move between closures in the same set of
    closures.  For example for [f] and [g] as above, represented together as a
    set of closures, we might apply [Project_closure] to extract the closure for [g],
    and later decide to use [Project_closure] again on this value (not on the set of
    closures) to access the closure for [f].  This is used when inlining
    mutually-recursive functions as a means of avoiding having to keep around
    a value corresponding to the whole set of closures.  For example,
    continuing from the example above:

      {[ Project_closure { closure = Var g; closure_id = id_f;
                    relative_to = Some id_g } ]}

    After closure conversion an inlining pass is performed.  This may
    introduce [Project_var] expressions to represent accesses (from
    the body of inlined functions) to variables bound by closures.  Some of
    these [Project_var] expressions may survive in the tree after
    inlining has finished.

    Other features of this intermediate language are:

    - Access to constants across modules are performed with respect to
      named symbols in the object file (of type [Symbol.t]).

    - Direct calls are distinguished from indirect calls (as in [Clambda])
      using values of type [call_kind].

    - "Structured constants" built from the constructors in type [const]
      are not explicitly represented.  Instead, they are converted into
      expressions such as: [Prim (Pmakeblock(...), ...)].

  (** During the lifting of [let] bindings to [program] constructions after
      closure conversion, we generate symbols and their corresponding
      definitions (which may or may not be constant), together with field
      accesses to such symbols.  We would like it to be the case that such
      field accesses are simplified to the relevant component of the
      symbol concerned.  (The rationale is to generate efficient code and
      share constants as expected: see e.g. tests/asmcomp/staticalloc.ml.)
      The components of the symbol would be identified by other symbols.
      This sort of access pattern is feasible because the top-level structure
      of symbols is statically allocated and fixed at compile time.
      It may seem that [Prim (Pfield, ...)] expressions could be used to
      perform the field accesses.  However for simplicity, to avoid having to
      keep track of properties of individual fields of blocks,
      [Inconstant_idents] never deems a [Prim (Pfield, ...)] expression to be
      constant.  This would in general prevent field accesses to symbols from
      being simplified in the way we would like, since [Lift_constants] would
      not assign new symbols (i.e. the things we would like to simplify to)
      to the various projections from the symbols in question.
      To circumvent this problem we use [Read_symbol_field] when generating
      projections from the top level of symbols.  Owing to the properties of
      symbols described above, such expressions may be eligible for declaration
      as constant by [Inconstant_idents] (and thus themselves lifted to another
      symbol), without any further complication.
      [Read_symbol_field] may only be used when the definition of the symbol
      is in scope in the [program].  For external unresolved symbols, [Pfield]
      may still be used; it will be changed to [Read_symbol_field] by
      [Inline_and_simplify] when (and if) the symbol is imported. *)

  (** Parameters known to always alias some variable in the scope of the set
      of closures declaration. For instance, supposing all call sites of f

         let f a b c = ... in
         let y = ... in
         f x y 1;
         f x y 1]
      the specialised arguments of f can (but does not necessarily) contain
      the association [a] -> [x], but cannot contain [b] -> [y] because [f]
      is not in the scope of [y]. If f were the recursive function
      [let rec f a b c = f a 1 2 in], [a] -> [x] would still be a valid
      specialised argument because all recursive calls maintain the invariant.

      This information is used for optimisation purposes, if such a binding is
      known, it is possible to specialise the body of the function according
      to its parameter. This is usually introduced when specialising a
      recursive function, for instance.
        [let rec map f = function
           | [] -> []
           | h :: t -> f h :: map f t
         let map_succ l =
           let succ x = x + 1 in
           map succ l]
      [map] can be duplicated in [map_succ] to be specialised for the argument
      [f]. This will result in
        [let map_succ l =
           let succ x = x + 1 in
           let rec map f = function
             | [] -> []
             | h :: t -> f h :: map f t in
           map succ l]
      with map having [f] -> [succ] in its [specialised_args] field.

      Note that it is usually not correct to erase this information if the
      argument is used.
