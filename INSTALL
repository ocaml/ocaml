INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1- Edit the file Makefile.config, following the comments in that file.

2- Configure the system. Change to the config/ subdirectory and do:

        make

This generates the two configuration files "m.h" and "s.h" in the
config/ subdirectory.  If something goes wrong during the make,
or if the generated "m.h" and "s.h" files cause errors later on, then do

        cp m-templ.h m.h
        cp s-templ.h s.h

and edit "m.h" and "s.h" by hand, following the guidelines in the
comments.

3- From the top directory, do:

        make world

This builds the Caml Special Light bytecode compiler for the first time.
This phase is fairly verbose; consider redirecting the output to a file:

        make world > log.world 2>&1     # in sh
        make world >& log.world         # in csh

4- To be sure everything works well, you can try to bootstrap the
system --- that is, to recompile all Caml Special Light sources with
the newly created compiler. From the top directory, do:

        make bootstrap

or, better:

        make bootstrap > log.bootstrap 2>&1     # in sh
        make bootstrap >& log.bootstrap         # in csh

The "make bootstrap" checks that the bytecode programs compiled with
the new compiler are identical to the bytecode programs compiled with
the old compiler. If this is the case, you can be pretty sure the
system has been correctly compiled. Otherwise, this does not
necessarily means something went wrong. The best thing to do is to try
a second bootstrapping phase: just do "make bootstrap" again.  It will
either crash almost immediately, or re-re-compile everything correctly
and reach the fixpoint.

5- If your platform is supported by the native-code compiler (that is,
Makefile.config sets ARCH to a value other than "none"), you can now
build the native-code compiler. From the top directory, do:

        make opt
or:
        make opt > log.opt 2>&1     # in sh
        make opt >& log.opt         # in csh

6- You can now install the Caml Special Light system. This will create the
following commands (in the directory set to BINDIR in Makefile.config):

        cslc           the batch bytecode compiler
        cslopt         the batch native-code compiler (if supported)
        cslrun         the runtime system for the bytecode compiler
        cslyacc        the parser generator
        csllex         the lexer generator
        csltop         the interactive, toplevel-based system
        cslmktop       a tool to make toplevel systems that integrate
                       user-defined C primitives and Caml code
        csldep         output "make" dependencies for Caml sources

From the top directory, become superuser and do "make install".
Also do "make installopt" to install the native-code compiler, if you
have compiled it.

7- Installation is complete. Time to clean up. From the toplevel
directory, do "make realclean".


IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG:

Read the "common problems" and "machine-specific hints" section at the
end of this file.

Check the files m.h and s.h in config/. Wrong endianness or alignment
constraints in m.h will immediately crash the bytecode interpreter.

If you get a "segmentation violation" signal, check the limits on the
stack size and data segment size (type "limit" under csh or
"ulimit -a" under bash). Make sure the limit on the stack size is
at least 2M.

Try recompiling the runtime system with optimizations turned off
(change CFLAGS in byterun/Makefile and asmrun/Makefile).
The runtime system contains some complex, atypical pieces of C code
that can uncover bugs in optimizing compilers. Alternatively, try
another C compiler (e.g. gcc instead of the vendor-supplied cc).

You can also build a debug version of the runtime system. Go to the
byterun/ directory and do "make camlrund". Then, copy camlrund to
../boot/camlrun, and try again. This version of the runtime system
contains lots of assertions and sanity checks that could help you
pinpoint the problem.


COMMON PROBLEMS:

* The Makefiles use the "include" directive, which is not supported by
older versions of make. Use GNU make instead.

* The Makefiles assume that make execute commands by calling /bin/sh. They
won't work if /bin/csh is called instead. You may have to unset the SHELL
environment variable, or set it to /bin/sh.

* gcc 2.6.0 has been reported to generate incorrect code for the
runtime system in -O mode. Upgrade to 2.6.3 or newer.

* If you're using gcc on the I386 or Motorola 680x0, make sure to set
the -fno-defer-pop option in $(BYTECCCOMPOPTS). Otherwise, there's a
bug in gcc that causes the bytecode interpreter to push stack frames
without popping them, causing stack overflows for long-running
bytecode programs.

MACHINE-SPECIFIC HINTS:

* On SparcStations 1, 1+, 2 (and other models with Sparc version 7
processors) under SunOS 4.1.2: programs using integer division or
integer modulus crash on a segmentation fault when compiled with
cslopt. The same programs work fine under SunOS 4.1.1, 4.1.3 and
4.1.4, so it looks very much like a kernel bug in the
emulation of the sdiv instruction. Consider an upgrade to 4.1.3 or
higher.

* On HP 9000/700 machines under HP/UX 9.  Some versions of cc are
unable to compile correctly the runtime system (wrong code is
generated for (x - y) where x is a pointer and y an integer).
Fix: use gcc.

* On some Next machines. cc pretends to be gcc but is not quite gcc.
If the compilation of byterun/interp.c causes syntax errors, insert
#undef __GNUC__ at the very beginning of byterun/misc.h.
