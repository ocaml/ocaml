# XXX is one of OC, OCAML or the name of a module. The OC prefix
# is for private variables (i.e. reserved by the compiler's build system),
# the OCAML prefix is used for variables the user can define to add their
# own flags and the module-name prefix is for flags that apply only
# to one module.
#
# YYY refers to the backend. At the moment, it can take the values
# COMMON for the flags shared by all the backends, BYTECODE or NATIVE
# (other backends may be added in the future).
#
# ZZZ is either CFLAGS (compile-time flags) or LDFLAGS (link-time flags).
# However, contrary to what is done for C compilers, the flags in the
# CFLAGS category are not passed at link time, so if a flag is needed
# at both stages, like e.g. -g, it should be added to both XXX_YYY_CFLAGS and
# XXX_YYY_LDFLAGS.
