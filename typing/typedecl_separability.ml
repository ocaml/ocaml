(** Coinductive hypotheses to handle equi-recursive types

    OCaml allows infinite/cyclic types, such as
      (int * 'a) as 'a
    whose infinite unfolding is (int * (int * (int * (int * ...)))).

    Remark: this specific type is only accepted if the -rectypes option
    is passed, but such "equi-recursive types" are accepted by
    default if the cycle goes through an object type or polymorphic
    variant type:
      [ `int | `other of 'a ] as 'a
      < head : int; rest : 'a > as 'a

    We have to take those infinite types in account in our
    separability-checking program: a naive implementation would loop
    infinitely when trying to prove that one of them is Deepsep.

    After type-checking, the cycle-introducing form (... as 'a) does
    not appear explicitly in the syntax of types: types are graphs/trees
    with cycles in them, and we have to use the type_expr.id field,
    an identifier for each node in the graph/tree, to detect cycles.

    We avoid looping by remembering the set of separability queries
    that we have already asked ourselves (in the current
    search branch). For example, if we are asked to check

      (int * 'a) : Deepsep

    our algorithm will check both (int : Deepsep) and ('a : Deepsep),
    but it will remember in these sub-checks that it is in the process
    of checking (int * 'a) : Deepsep, adding it to a list of "active
    goals", or "coinductive hypotheses".

    Each new sub-query will start by checking whether the query
    already appears as a coinductive hypothesis; in our example, this
    can happen if 'a and (int * 'a) are in fact the same node in the
    cyclic tree. In that case, we return immediately (instead of looping):
    we reason that, assuming that 'a is indeed Deepsep, then it is
    the case that (int * 'a) is also Deepsep.

    This kind of cyclic reasoning can be dangerous: it would be wrong
    to argue that an arbitrary 'a type is Deepsep by saying:
    "assuming that 'a is Deepsep, then it is the case that 'a is
    also Deepsep". In the first case, we made an assumption on 'a,
    and used it on a type (int * 'a) which has 'a as a strict sub-component;
    in the second, we use it on the same type 'a directly, which is invalid.

    Now consider a type of the form (('a t) as 'a): while 'a is a sub-component
    of ('a t), it may still be wrong to reason coinductively about it,
    as ('a t) may be defined as (type 'a t = 'a).

    When moving from (int * 'a) to a subcomponent (int) or ('a), we
    say that the coinductive hypothesis on (int * 'a : m) is "safe":
    it can be used immediately to prove the subcomponents, because we
    made progress moving to a strict subcomponent (we are guarded
    under a computational type constructor). On the other hand, when
    moving from ('a t) to ('a), we say that the coinductive hypothesis
    ('a t : m) is "unsafe" for the subgoal, as we don't know whether
    we have made strict progress. In the general case, we keep track
    of a set of safe and unsafe hypotheses made in the past, and we
    use them to terminate checking if we encounter them again,
    ensuring termination.

    If we encounter a (ty : m) goal that is exactly a safe hypothesis,
    we terminate with a success. In fact, we can use mode subtyping here:
    if (ty : m') appears as a hypothesis with (m' >= m), then we would
    succeed for (ty : m'), so (ty : m) should succeed as well.

    On the other hand, if we encounter a (ty : m) goal that is an
    *unsafe* hypothesis, we terminate the check with a failure. In this case,
    we cannot work modulo mode subtyping: if (ty : m') appears with
    (m' >= m), then the check (ty : m') would have failed, but it is still
    possible that the weaker current query (ty : m) would succeed.

    In usual coinductive-reasoning systems, unsafe hypotheses are turned
    into safe hypotheses each time strict progress is made (for each
    guarded sub-goal). Consider ((int * 'a) t as 'a : deepsep) for example:
    the idea is that the ((int * 'a) t : deepsep) hypothesis would be
    unsafe when checking ((int * 'a) : deepsep), but that the progress
    step from (int * 'a : deepsep) to ('a : deepsep) would turn all
    past unsafe hypotheses into safe hypotheses. There is a problem
    with this, though, due to constraints: what if (_ t) is defined as

      type 'b t = 'a constraint 'b = (int * 'a)

    ?

    In that case, then 'a is precisely the one-step unfolding
    of the ((int * 'a) t) definition, and it would be an invalid,
    cyclic reasoning to prove ('a : deepsep) from the now-safe
    hypothesis ((int * 'a) t : deepsep).

    Surprisingly-fortunately, we have exactly the information we need
    to know whether (_ t) may or may not pull a constraint trick of
    this nature: we can look at its mode signature, where constraints
    are marked by a Deepsep mode. If we see Deepsep, we know that a
    constraint exists, but we don't know what the constraint is:
    we cannot tell at which point, when decomposing the parameter type,
    a sub-component can be considered safe again. To model this,
    we add a third category of co-inductive hypotheses: to "safe" and
    "unsafe" we add the category of "poison" hypotheses, which remain
    poisonous during the remaining of the type decomposition,
    even in presence of safe, computational types constructors:

    - when going under a computational constructor,
      "unsafe" hypotheses become "safe"
    - when going under a constraining type (more precisely, under
      a type parameter that is marked Deepsep in the mode signature),
      "unsafe" hypotheses become "poison"

    The mode signature tells us even a bit more: if a parameter
    is marked "Ind", we know that the type constructor cannot unfold
    to this parameter (otherwise it would be Sep), so going under
    this parameter can be considered a safe/guarded move: if
    we have to check (foo t : m) with ((_ : Ind) t) in the signature,
    we can recursively check (foo : Ind) with (foo t : m) marked
    as "safe", rather than "unsafe".

(** [msig_of_context ~decl_loc constructor context] returns the
   separability signature of a single-constructor type whose
   definition is valid in the mode context [context].

   Note: A GADT constructor introduces existential type variables, and
   may also introduce some equalities between its return type
   parameters and type expressions containing universal and
   existential variables. In other words, it introduces new type
   variables in scope, and restricts existing variables by adding
   equality constraints.

   [msig_of_context] performs the reverse transformation: the context
   [ctx] computed from the argument of the constructor mentions
   existential variables, and the function returns a context over the
   (universal) type parameters only. (Type constraints do not
   introduce existential variables, but they do introduce equalities;
   they are handled as GADTs equalities by this function.)

   The transformation is separability-preserving in the following
   sense: for any valid instance of the result mode signature
   (replacing the universal type parameters with ground types
   respecting the variable's separability mode), any possible
   extension of this context instance with ground instances for the
   existential variables of [parameter] that respects the equation
   constraints will validate the separability requirements of the
   modes in the input context [ctx].

   Sometimes no such universal context exists, as an existential type
   cannot be safely introduced, then this function raises an [Error]
   exception with a [Non_separable_evar] payload.  *)

      (* In the theory, GADT equations are of the form
           ('a = <ty>)
         for each type parameter 'a of the type constructor. For each
         such equation, we should "strengthen" the current context in
         the following way:
         - if <ty> is another variable 'b,
           the mode of 'a is set to the mode of 'b,
           and 'b is set to Ind
         - if <ty> is a type expression whose variables are all Ind,
           set 'a to Ind and discard the equation
         - otherwise (one of the variable of 'b is not Ind),
           set 'a to Deepsep and set all variables of <ty> to Ind

         In practice, type parameters are determined by their position
         in a list, they do not necessarily have a corresponding type variable.
         Instead of "setting 'a" in the context as in the description above,
         we build a list of modes by repeated consing into
         an accumulator variable [acc], setting existential variables
         to Ind as we go. *)

      (* Note: our inference system is not principal, because the
         inference result depends on the order in which those
         equations are processed. (To our knowledge this is the only
         source of non-principality.) If two parameters ('a, 'b) are
         forced to be equal to each other, and also separable, then
         either modes (Sep, Ind) and (Ind, Sep) are correct, allow
         more declarations than (Sep, Sep), but (Ind, Ind) would be
         unsound.

         Such a non-principal example is the following:

           type ('a, 'b) almost_eq =
             | Almost_refl : 'c -> ('c, 'c) almost_eq

         (This example looks strange: GADT equations are typically
         either on only one parameter, or on two parameters that are
         not used to classify constructor arguments. Indeed, we have
         not found non-principal declarations in real-world code.)

         In a non-principal system, it is important the our choice of
         non-unique solution be at least predictable. We find it more
         natural, when either ('a : Sep, 'b : Ind) and ('a : Ind,
         'b : Sep) are correct because 'a = 'b, to choose to make the
         first/leftmost parameter more constrained. We read this as
         saying that 'a must be Sep, and 'b = 'a so 'b can be
         Ind. (We define the second parameter as equal of the first,
         already-seen parameter; instead of saying that the first
         parameter is equal to the not-yet-seen second one.)

         This is achieved by processing the equations from left to
         right with List.fold_left, instead of using
         List.fold_right. The code is slightly more awkward as it
         needs a List.rev on the accumulated modes, but it gives
         a more predictable/natural (non-principal) behavior.
