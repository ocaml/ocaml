(** {0 Representation of types and declarations} *)

(** [Types] defines the representation of types and declarations (that is, the
    content of module signatures).

    CMI files are made of marshalled types.
*)

(** Asttypes exposes basic definitions shared both by Parsetree and Types. *)
open Asttypes

(** Type expressions for the core language.

    The [type_desc] variant defines all the possible type expressions one can
    find in OCaml. [type_expr] wraps this with some annotations.

    The [level] field tracks the level of polymorphism associated to a type,
    guiding the generalization algorithm.
    Put shortly, when referring to a type in a given environment, both the type
    and the environment have a level. If the type has an higher level, then it
    can be considered fully polymorphic (type variables will be printed as
    ['a]), otherwise it'll be weakly polymorphic, or non generalized (type
    variables printed as ['_a]).
    See [http://okmij.org/ftp/ML/generalization.html] for more information.

    Note about [type_declaration]: one should not make the confusion between
    [type_expr] and [type_declaration].

    [type_declaration] refers specifically to the [type] construct in OCaml
    language, where you create and name a new type or type alias.

    [type_expr] is used when you refer to existing types, e.g. when annotating
    the expected type of a value.

    Also, as the type system of OCaml is generative, a [type_declaration] can
    have the side-effect of introducing a new type constructor, different from
    all other known types.
    Whereas [type_expr] is a pure construct which allows referring to existing
    types.

    Note on mutability: TBD.

      The last parameter keep tracks of known expansions, see [abbrev_memo]. *)

  | Tobject of type_expr * (Path.t * type_expr list) option ref
  (** [Tobject (`f1:t1;...;fn: tn', `None')] ==> [< f1: t1; ...; fn: tn >]
      f1, fn are represented as a linked list of types using Tfield and Tnil
      constructors.

      [Tobject (_, `Some (`A.ct', [t1;...;tn]')] ==> [(t1, ..., tn) A.ct].
      where A.ct is the type of some class.

      There are also special cases for so-called "class-types", cf. [Typeclass]
      and [Ctype.set_object_name]:

        [Tobject (Tfield(_,_,...(Tfield(_,_,rv)...),
                         Some(`A.#ct`, [rv;t1;...;tn])]

        [Tobject (_, Some(`A.#ct`, [Tnil;t1;...;tn])] ==> [(t1, ..., tn) A.ct]

      where [rv] is the hidden row variable.

  | Tfield of string * field_kind * type_expr * type_expr
  (** [Tfield ("foo", field_public, t, ts)] ==> [<...; foo : t; ts>] *)

  | Tnil
  (** [Tnil] ==> [<...; >] *)

  | Tlink of type_expr
  (** Indirection used by unification engine. *)

  | Tsubst of type_expr * type_expr option
  (** [Tsubst] is used temporarily to store information in low-level
      functions manipulating representation of types, such as
      instantiation or copy.
      The first argument contains a copy of the original node.
      The second is available only when the first is the row variable of
      a polymorphic variant.  It then contains a copy of the whole variant.
      This constructor should not appear outside of these cases. *)

      forall quantifier / [Tpoly]. *)

  | Tpoly of type_expr * type_expr list
  (** [Tpoly (ty,tyl)] ==> ['a1... 'an. ty],
      where 'a1 ... 'an are names given to types in tyl
      and occurrences of those types in ty. *)

  | Tpackage of Path.t * (Longident.t * type_expr) list
  (** Type of a first-class module (a.k.a package). *)

and fixed_explanation =

  | Fixed_private (** The row type is private *)
  | Reified of Path.t (** The row was reified *)
  | Rigid (** The row type was made rigid during constraint verification *)

(** [abbrev_memo] allows one to keep track of different expansions of a type
    alias. This is done for performance purposes.

    For instance, when defining [type 'a pair = 'a * 'a], when one refers to an
    ['a pair], it is just a shortcut for the ['a * 'a] type.
    This expansion will be stored in the [abbrev_memo] of the corresponding
    [Tconstr] node.

    In practice, [abbrev_memo] behaves like list of expansions with a mutable
    tail.

    Note on marshalling: [abbrev_memo] must not appear in saved types.
    [Btype], with [cleanup_abbrev] and [memo], takes care of tracking and
    removing abbreviations.
*)
and abbrev_memo =
  | Mnil (** No known abbreviation *)

  | Mcons of private_flag * Path.t * type_expr * type_expr * abbrev_memo
  (** Found one abbreviation.
      A valid abbreviation should be at least as visible and reachable by the
      same path.
      The first expression is the abbreviation and the second the expansion. *)

  | Mlink of abbrev_memo ref
  (** Abbreviations can be found after this indirection *)

(** [commutable] is a flag appended to every arrow type.

    When typing an application, if the type of the functional is
    known, its type is instantiated with [commu_ok] arrows, otherwise as
    [commu_var ()].

    When the type is not known, the application will be used to infer
    the actual type.  This is fragile in presence of labels where
    there is no principal type.

    Two incompatible applications must rely on [is_commu_ok] arrows,
    otherwise they will trigger an error.

    let f g =
      g ~a:() ~b:();
      g ~b:() ~a:();

    Error: This function is applied to arguments
    in an order different from other calls.
    This is only allowed when the real type is known.

    An [Fprivate] field may become [Fpublic] or [Fabsent] during unification,
    but not the other way round.
