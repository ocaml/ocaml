(** {0 Representation of types and declarations} *)

(** [Types] defines the representation of types and declarations (that is, the
    content of module signatures).

    CMI files are made of marshalled types.
*)

(** Asttypes exposes basic definitions shared both by Parsetree and Types. *)
open Asttypes

(** Type expressions for the core language.

    The [type_desc] variant defines all the possible type expressions one can
    find in OCaml. [type_expr] wraps this with some annotations.

    The [level] field tracks the level of polymorphism associated to a type,
    guiding the generalization algorithm.
    Put shortly, when referring to a type in a given environment, both the type
    and the environment have a level. If the type has an higher level, then it
    can be considered fully polymorphic (type variables will be printed as
    ['a]), otherwise it'll be weakly polymorphic, or non generalized (type
    variables printed as ['_a]).
    See [http://okmij.org/ftp/ML/generalization.html] for more information.

    Note about [type_declaration]: one should not make the confusion between
    [type_expr] and [type_declaration].

    [type_declaration] refers specifically to the [type] construct in OCaml
    language, where you create and name a new type or type alias.

    [type_expr] is used when you refer to existing types, e.g. when annotating
    the expected type of a value.

    Also, as the type system of OCaml is generative, a [type_declaration] can
    have the side-effect of introducing a new type constructor, different from
    all other known types.
    Whereas [type_expr] is a pure construct which allows referring to existing
    types.

    Note on mutability: TBD.

(** [abbrev_memo] allows one to keep track of different expansions of a type

    For instance, when defining [type 'a pair = 'a * 'a], when one refers to an
    ['a pair], it is just a shortcut for the ['a * 'a] type.
    This expansion will be stored in the [abbrev_memo] of the corresponding
    [Tconstr] node.

    In practice, [abbrev_memo] behaves like list of expansions with a mutable
    tail.

    When the type is not known, the application will be used to infer
    the actual type.  This is fragile in presence of labels where
    there is no principal type.

    Two incompatible applications relying on [Cunknown] arrows will
    trigger an error.
