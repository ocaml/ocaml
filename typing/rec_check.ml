(** Static checking of recursive declarations

Some recursive definitions are meaningful
{[
  let rec factorial = function 0 -> 1 | n -> n * factorial (n - 1)
  let rec infinite_list = 0 :: infinite_list
]}
but some other are meaningless
{[
  let rec x = x
  let rec x = x+1
|}

Intuitively, a recursive definition makes sense when the body of the
definition can be evaluated without fully knowing what the recursive
name is yet.

In the [factorial] example, the name [factorial] refers to a function,
evaluating the function definition [function ...] can be done
immediately and will not force a recursive call to [factorial] -- this
will only happen later, when [factorial] is called with an argument.

In the [infinite_list] example, we can evaluate [0 :: infinite_list]
without knowing the full content of [infinite_list], but with just its
address. This is a case of productive/guarded recursion.

On the contrary, [let rec x = x] is unguarded recursion (the meaning
is undetermined), and [let rec x = x+1] would need the value of [x]
while evaluating its definition [x+1].

This file implements a static check to decide which definitions are
known to be meaningful, and which may be meaningless. In the general
case, we handle a set of mutually-recursive definitions
{[
let rec x1 = e1
and x2 = e2
...
and xn = en
]}


Our check (see function [is_valid_recursive_expression] is defined
using two criteria:

Usage of recursive variables: how does each of the [e1 .. en] use the
 recursive variables [x1 .. xn]?

Static or dynamic size: for which of the [ei] can we compute the
  in-memory size of the value without evaluating [ei] (so that we can
  pre-allocate it, and thus know its final address before evaluation).

The "static or dynamic size" is decided by the classify_* functions below.

The "variable usage" question is decided by a static analysis looking
very much like a type system. The idea is to assign "access modes" to
variables, where an "access mode" [m] is defined as either

    m ::= Ignore (* the value is not used at all *)
        | Delay (* the value is not needed at definition time *)
        | Guard (* the value is stored under a data constructor *)
        | Return (* the value result is directly returned *)
        | Dereference (* full access and inspection of the value *)

The access modes of an expression [e] are represented by a "context"
[G], which is simply a mapping from variables (the variables used in
[e]) to access modes.

The core notion of the static check is a type-system-like judgment of
the form [G |- e : m], which can be interpreted as meaning either of:

- If we are allowed to use the variables of [e] at the modes in [G]
  (but not more), then it is safe to use [e] at the mode [m].

- If we want to use [e] at the mode [m], then its variables are
  used at the modes in [G].

In practice, for a given expression [e], our implementation takes the
desired mode of use [m] as *input*, and returns a context [G] as
*output*, which is (uniquely determined as) the most permissive choice
of modes [G] for the variables of [e] such that [G |- e : m] holds.

(* Usage mode judgments.

   There are two main groups of judgment functions:

   - Judgments of the form "G |- ... : m"
     compute the environment G of a subterm ... from its mode m, so
     the corresponding function has type [... -> Mode.t -> Env.t].

     We write [... -> term_judg] in this case.

   - Judgments of the form "G |- ... : m -| G'"

     correspond to binding constructs (for example "let x = e" in the
     term "let x = e in body") that have both an exterior environment
     G (the environment of the whole term "let x = e in body") and an
     interior environment G' (the environment at the "in", after the
     binding construct has introduced new names in scope).

     For example, let-binding could be given the following rule:

       G |- e : m + m'
       -----------------------------------
       G+G' |- (let x = e) : m -| x:m', G'

     Checking the whole term composes this judgment
     with the "G |- e : m" form for the let body:

       G  |- (let x = e) : m -| G'
       G' |- body : m
       -------------------------------
       G |- let x = e in body : m

     To this judgment "G |- e : m -| G'" our implementation gives the
     type [... -> Mode.t -> Env.t -> Env.t]: it takes the mode and
     interior environment as inputs, and returns the exterior
     environment.

     We write [... -> bind_judg] in this case.

           The (mdef_ij)^i,j are a family of modes over two indices:
           mdef_ij represents the mode of use, within e_i the definition of x_i,
           of the mutually-recursive variable x_j.

           The (G'i)^i are defined from the (Gi)^i as a family of equations,
           whose smallest solution is computed as a least fixpoint.

           The (Gi)^i are the "immediate" dependencies of each (ei)^i
           on the outer context (excluding the mutually-defined
           variables).
           The (G'i)^i contain the "transitive" dependencies as well:
           if ei depends on xj, then the dependencies of G'i of xi
           must contain the dependencies of G'j, composed by
           the mode mdef_ij of use of xj in ei.

           For example, consider:

             let rec z =
               let rec x = ref y
               and y = ref z
               in f x

           this definition should be rejected as the body [f x]
           dereferences [x], which can be used to access the
           yet-unitialized value [z]. This requires realizing that [x]
           depends on [z] through [y], which requires the transitive
           closure computation.

           An earlier version of our check would take only the (Gi)^i
           instead of the (G'i)^i, which is incorrect and would accept
           the example above.
