= Bootstrapping the compiler

This file explains how to bootstrap the OCaml compiler, i.e. how to
update the binaries in the link:boot/[] directory.

A bootstrap is required for example when something changes in the
runtime system (the magic number of bytecode executables, the format of
bytecode instructions, the set of available primitives) or when the
format of .cmi files is modified. In particular, given that the .cmi
files contain information related to types, modifying the way a type is
represented will modify the format of .cmi files and thus require a
bootstrap.

Here is how to perform a change that requires a bootstrap:

1. Make sure you start with a clean source tree (e.g. check with
   `git status`)

2. Configure your source tree by running:

        ./configure

3. Bring your system to a stable state. Concretely, this means that the
   boot/ directory should contain a version of ocamlrun and all the
   \*.cm* files of the standard library. This stable state can be reached
   by running

        make world
+
(Actually, running `make coldstart` should be enough but `make world` is
safer. Similarly, `make world.opt` will also bring you to such a stable
state but builds more things than actually required.)

4. Now, and only now, edit the sources. Changes here may include adding,
   removing or renaming a primitive in the runtime, changing the magic
   number of bytecode executable files, changing the way types are
   represented or anything else in the format of .cmi files, etc.

5. Run:

        make coreall
+
This will rebuild runtime/ocamlrun, ocamlc, etc.

6. (optional) The new system can now be tested:

        echo 'let _ = print_string "Hello world!\n"' > foo.ml
        ./boot/ocamlrun ./ocamlc -I ./stdlib foo.ml
        ./runtime/ocamlrun a.out

7. We now know the system works and can thus build the new boot/
   binaries:

        make bootstrap

If you notice that this procedure fails for a given change you are
trying to implement, please report it so that the procedure can be
updated to also cope with your change.
