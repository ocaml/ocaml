(** A mapper record implements one "method" per syntactic category,
    using an open recursion style: each method takes as its first
    argument the mapper to be applied to children in the syntax
    tree. *)

val default_mapper: mapper
(** A default mapper, which implements a "deep identity" mapping. *)

(** {2 Apply mappers to compilation units} *)

val apply: source:string -> target:string -> mapper -> unit
(** Apply a mapper (parametrized by the unit name) to a dumped
    parsetree found in the [source] file and put the result in the
    [target] file. The [structure] or [signature] field of the mapper
    is applied to the implementation or interface.  *)

val run_main: (string list -> mapper) -> unit
(** Entry point to call to implement a standalone -ppx rewriter from a
    mapper, parametrized by the command line arguments.  The current
    unit name can be obtained from [Location.input_name].  This
    function implements proper error reporting for uncaught
    exceptions. *)

(** {2 Registration API} *)

val register_function: (string -> (string list -> mapper) -> unit) ref

val register: string -> (string list -> mapper) -> unit

(** Apply the [register_function].  The default behavior is to run the
    mapper immediately, taking arguments from the process command
    line.  This is to support a scenario where a mapper is linked as a
    stand-alone executable.

    It is possible to overwrite the [register_function] to define
    "-ppx drivers", which combine several mappers in a single process.
    Typically, a driver starts by defining [register_function] to a
    custom implementation, then lets ppx rewriters (linked statically
    or dynamically) register themselves, and then run all or some of
    them.  It is also possible to have -ppx drivers apply rewriters to
    only specific parts of an AST.

    The first argument to [register] is a symbolic name to be used by
    the ppx driver.  *)

val extension_of_error: Location.error -> extension
(** Encode an error into an 'ocaml.error' extension node which can be
    inserted in a generated Parsetree.  The compiler will be
    responsible for reporting the error. *)

val attribute_of_warning: Location.t -> string -> attribute
(** Encode a warning message into an 'ocaml.ppwarning' attribute which can be
    inserted in a generated Parsetree.  The compiler will be
    responsible for reporting the warning. *)
