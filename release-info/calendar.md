# Prospective release calendar

This is a prospective calendar for the next releases of OCaml.

This document is intended to give a very rough idea of the timeline for the next
versions of OCaml to anyone interested. However, it would be an unforeseen
accident if this prospective calendar ever matches the real release calendar.
