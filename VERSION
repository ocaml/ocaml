5.00.0+dev0-2021-11-05

# Starting with OCaml 4.14, although the version string that appears above is
# still correct and this file can thus still be used to figure it out,
# the version itself is actually defined in the build-aux/ocaml_version.m4
# file (See the OCAML__VERSION* macros there.)
# To update the present VERSION file:
# 1. Update build-aux/ocaml_version.m4
# 2. Run tools/autogen.
# 3. If you are in a context where version control matters,
# commit the changes to both build-aux/ocaml_version.m4 and VERSION.
# The version string must be in the format described in stdlib/sys.mli
