== Overview

OCaml is a functional, statically-typed programming language from the
ML family, offering a powerful module system extending that of
Standard ML and a feature-rich, class-based object system.

OCaml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode which is then
interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly, generates
compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is portable to
many 32 or 64 bit platforms. Performance of generated programs is
quite good for a bytecoded implementation.  This compiler can be used
either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces
standalone programs, or as an interactive REPL system.

The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number of
processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but the
generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining the
moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. The native-code
compiler currently runs on the following platforms:

|====
|                |  Tier 1 (actively maintained)   | Tier 2 (maintained when possible)

| x86 64 bits    | Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD  |  NetBSD, OpenBSD
| x86 32 bits    | Linux, Windows                  |  FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
| ARM 64 bits    | Linux, macOS                    |  FreeBSD
| ARM 32 bits    | Linux                           |  FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
| Power 64 bits  | Linux                           |
| Power 32 bits  | Linux                           |
| RISC-V 64 bits | Linux                           |
| IBM Z (s390x)  | Linux                           |
|====

Other operating systems for the processors above have not been tested, but
the compiler may work under other operating systems with little work.

== Keeping in Touch with the Caml Community

There is an active and friendly discussion forum at

https://discuss.ocaml.org/

The OCaml mailing list is the longest-running forum for OCaml users.
You can email it at

mailto:caml-list@inria.fr[]

You can subscribe and access list archives via the Web interface at

https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/subscribe/caml-list

An alternative archive of the mailing list is also available at

https://inbox.ocaml.org/

There also exist other mailing lists, chat channels, and various other forums
around the internet for getting in touch with the OCaml and ML family language
community. These can be accessed at

https://ocaml.org/community/

In particular, the IRC channel `#ocaml` on https://libera.chat/[Libera] has a
long history and welcomes questions.

== Bug Reports and User Feedback

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues

To be effective, bug reports should include a complete program (preferably
small) that exhibits the unexpected behavior, and the configuration you are
using (machine type, etc).

For information on contributing to OCaml, see link:HACKING.adoc[] and
link:CONTRIBUTING.md[].
