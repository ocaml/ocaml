=== ⚠️ CAUTION

The developer team released OCaml 5.0.0 in December 2022. This release sports a
full rewrite of its runtime system for shared-memory parallel programming using
domains and native support for concurrent programming using effect handlers.

Owing to the large number of changes, the initial 5.0 release is more
experimental than usual.  It is recommended that all users wanting a stable
release use the 4.14 release which will continue to be supported and updated
while 5.x reaches feature and stability parity. Similarly, if you need one of
the ports not yet supported in the 5.0 release you must use the 4.14 release.

The initial release of OCaml 5.0 only supports the native compiler under ARM64
and x86-64 architectures under Linux, macOS and the BSDs. On Windows, only the
MinGW-w64 port is supported.  Support for other 64-bit architectures and
systems will be added back in later releases. On 32-bit systems, only the
bytecode compiler will be supported.

== Overview

OCaml is a functional, statically-typed programming language from the
ML family, offering a powerful module system extending that of
Standard ML and a feature-rich, class-based object system.

OCaml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode which is then
interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly, generates
compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is portable to
many 32 or 64 bit platforms. Performance of generated programs is
quite good for a bytecoded implementation.  This compiler can be used
either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces
standalone programs, or as an interactive REPL system.

The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number of
processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but the
generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining the
moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. The native-code
compiler currently runs on the following platforms:

|====
|                |  Tier 1 (actively maintained)   | Tier 2 (maintained when possible)

| x86 64 bits    | Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD  |  NetBSD, OpenBSD
| ARM 64 bits    | Linux, macOS                    |  FreeBSD
| Power 64 bits  | Linux                           |
| RISC-V 64 bits | Linux                           |
| IBM Z (s390x)  | Linux                           |
|====

Other operating systems for the processors above have not been tested, but
the compiler may work under other operating systems with little work.

long history and welcomes questions.

== Bug Reports and User Feedback

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at
https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues

To be effective, bug reports should include a complete program (preferably
small) that exhibits the unexpected behavior, and the configuration you are
using (machine type, etc).
