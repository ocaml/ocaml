open General

(* This signature describes the incremental LR engine. *)

(* In this mode, the user controls the lexer, and the parser suspends
   itself when it needs to read a new token. *)

module type INCREMENTAL_ENGINE = sig

  type token

  (* A value of type [production] is (an index for) a production. The start
     productions (which do not exist in an \mly file, but are constructed by
     Menhir internally) are not part of this type. *)

  type production

  (* The type ['a checkpoint] represents an intermediate or final state of the
     parser. An intermediate checkpoint is a suspension: it records the parser's
     current state, and allows parsing to be resumed. The parameter ['a] is
     the type of the semantic value that will eventually be produced if the
     parser succeeds. *)

  (* [Accepted] and [Rejected] are final checkpoints. [Accepted] carries a
     semantic value. *)

  (* [InputNeeded] is an intermediate checkpoint. It means that the parser wishes
     to read one token before continuing. *)

  (* [Shifting] is an intermediate checkpoint. It means that the parser is taking
     a shift transition. It exposes the state of the parser before and after
     the transition. The Boolean parameter tells whether the parser intends to
     request a new token after this transition. (It always does, except when
     it is about to accept.) *)

  (* [AboutToReduce] is an intermediate checkpoint. It means that the parser is
     about to perform a reduction step. It exposes the parser's current
     state as well as the production that is about to be reduced. *)

  (* [HandlingError] is an intermediate checkpoint. It means that the parser has
     detected an error and is currently handling it, in several steps. *)

  (* A value of type ['a env] represents a configuration of the automaton:
     current state, stack, lookahead token, etc. The parameter ['a] is the
     type of the semantic value that will eventually be produced if the parser
     succeeds. *)

  (* In normal operation, the parser works with checkpoints: see the functions
     [offer] and [resume]. However, it is also possible to work directly with
     environments (see the functions [pop], [force_reduction], and [feed]) and
     to reconstruct a checkpoint out of an environment (see [input_needed]).
     This is considered advanced functionality; its purpose is to allow error
     recovery strategies to be programmed by the user. *)

  type 'a env

  type 'a checkpoint = private
    | InputNeeded of 'a env
    | Shifting of 'a env * 'a env * bool
    | AboutToReduce of 'a env * production
    | HandlingError of 'a env
    | Accepted of 'a
    | Rejected

  (* [offer] allows the user to resume the parser after it has suspended
     itself with a checkpoint of the form [InputNeeded env]. [offer] expects the
     old checkpoint as well as a new token and produces a new checkpoint. It does not
     raise any exception. *)

  val offer:
    'a checkpoint ->
    token * position * position ->
    'a checkpoint

  (* [resume] allows the user to resume the parser after it has suspended
     itself with a checkpoint of the form [AboutToReduce (env, prod)] or
     [HandlingError env]. [resume] expects the old checkpoint and produces a new
     checkpoint. It does not raise any exception. *)

  val resume:
    'a checkpoint ->
    'a checkpoint

  (* A token supplier is a function of no arguments which delivers a new token
     (together with its start and end positions) every time it is called. *)

  type supplier =
    unit -> token * position * position

  (* A pair of a lexer and a lexing buffer can be easily turned into a supplier. *)

  val lexer_lexbuf_to_supplier:
    (Lexing.lexbuf -> token) ->
    Lexing.lexbuf ->
    supplier

  (* The functions [offer] and [resume] are sufficient to write a parser loop.
     One can imagine many variations (which is why we expose these functions
     in the first place!). Here, we expose a few variations of the main loop,
     ready for use. *)

  (* [loop supplier checkpoint] begins parsing from [checkpoint], reading
     tokens from [supplier]. It continues parsing until it reaches a
     checkpoint of the form [Accepted v] or [Rejected]. In the former case, it
     returns [v]. In the latter case, it raises the exception [Error]. *)

  val loop: supplier -> 'a checkpoint -> 'a

  (* [loop_handle succeed fail supplier checkpoint] begins parsing from
     [checkpoint], reading tokens from [supplier]. It continues parsing until
     it reaches a checkpoint of the form [Accepted v] or [HandlingError env]
     (or [Rejected], but that should not happen, as [HandlingError _] will be
     observed first). In the former case, it calls [succeed v]. In the latter
     case, it calls [fail] with this checkpoint. It cannot raise [Error].

     This means that Menhir's traditional error-handling procedure (which pops
     the stack until a state that can act on the [error] token is found) does
     not get a chance to run. Instead, the user can implement her own error
     handling code, in the [fail] continuation. *)

  val loop_handle:
    ('a -> 'answer) ->
    ('a checkpoint -> 'answer) ->
    supplier -> 'a checkpoint -> 'answer

  (* [loop_handle_undo] is analogous to [loop_handle], except it passes a pair
     of checkpoints to the failure continuation.

     The first (and oldest) checkpoint is the last [InputNeeded] checkpoint that
     was encountered before the error was detected. The second (and newest)
     checkpoint is where the error was detected, as in [loop_handle]. Going back
     to the first checkpoint can be thought of as undoing any reductions that
     were performed after seeing the problematic token. (These reductions must
     be default reductions or spurious reductions.)

     [loop_handle_undo] must initially be applied to an [InputNeeded] checkpoint.
     The parser's initial checkpoints satisfy this constraint. *)

  val loop_handle_undo:
    ('a -> 'answer) ->
    ('a checkpoint -> 'a checkpoint -> 'answer) ->
    supplier -> 'a checkpoint -> 'answer

  (* [shifts checkpoint] assumes that [checkpoint] has been obtained by
     submitting a token to the parser. It runs the parser from [checkpoint],
     through an arbitrary number of reductions, until the parser either
     accepts this token (i.e., shifts) or rejects it (i.e., signals an error).
     If the parser decides to shift, then [Some env] is returned, where [env]
     is the parser's state just before shifting. Otherwise, [None] is
     returned. *)

  (* It is desirable that the semantic actions be side-effect free, or that
     their side-effects be harmless (replayable). *)

  val shifts: 'a checkpoint -> 'a env option

  (* The function [acceptable] allows testing, after an error has been
     detected, which tokens would have been accepted at this point. It is
     implemented using [shifts]. Its argument should be an [InputNeeded]
     checkpoint. *)

  (* For completeness, one must undo any spurious reductions before carrying out
     this test -- that is, one must apply [acceptable] to the FIRST checkpoint
     that is passed by [loop_handle_undo] to its failure continuation. *)

  (* This test causes some semantic actions to be run! The semantic actions
     should be side-effect free, or their side-effects should be harmless. *)

  (* The position [pos] is used as the start and end positions of the
     hypothetical token, and may be picked up by the semantic actions. We
     suggest using the position where the error was detected. *)

  val acceptable: 'a checkpoint -> token -> position -> bool

  (* The abstract type ['a lr1state] describes the non-initial states of the
     LR(1) automaton. The index ['a] represents the type of the semantic value
     associated with this state's incoming symbol. *)

  type 'a lr1state

  (* The states of the LR(1) automaton are numbered (from 0 and up). *)

  val number: _ lr1state -> int

  (* Productions are numbered. *)

  (* [find_production i] requires the index [i] to be valid. Use with care. *)

  val production_index: production -> int
  val find_production: int -> production

  (* An element is a pair of a non-initial state [s] and a semantic value [v]
     associated with the incoming symbol of this state. The idea is, the value
     [v] was pushed onto the stack just before the state [s] was entered. Thus,
     for some type ['a], the state [s] has type ['a lr1state] and the value [v]
     has type ['a]. In other words, the type [element] is an existential type. *)

  type element =
    | Element: 'a lr1state * 'a * position * position -> element

  (* The parser's stack is (or, more precisely, can be viewed as) a stream of
     elements. The type [stream] is defined by the module [General]. *)

  (* As of 2017/03/31, the types [stream] and [stack] and the function [stack]
     are DEPRECATED. They might be removed in the future. An alternative way
     of inspecting the stack is via the functions [top] and [pop]. *)

  type stack = (* DEPRECATED *)
    element stream

  (* This is the parser's stack, a stream of elements. This stream is empty if
     the parser is in an initial state; otherwise, it is non-empty.  The LR(1)
     automaton's current state is the one found in the top element of the
     stack. *)

  val stack: 'a env -> stack (* DEPRECATED *)

  (* [top env] returns the parser's top stack element. The state contained in
     this stack element is the current state of the automaton. If the stack is
     empty, [None] is returned. In that case, the current state of the
     automaton must be an initial state. *)

  val top: 'a env -> element option

  (* [pop_many i env] pops [i] cells off the automaton's stack. This is done
     via [i] successive invocations of [pop]. Thus, [pop_many 1] is [pop]. The
     index [i] must be nonnegative. The time complexity is O(i). *)

  val pop_many: int -> 'a env -> 'a env option

  (* [get i env] returns the parser's [i]-th stack element. The index [i] is
     0-based: thus, [get 0] is [top]. If [i] is greater than or equal to the
     number of elements in the stack, [None] is returned. The time complexity
     is O(i). *)

  val get: int -> 'a env -> element option

  (* [current_state_number env] is (the integer number of) the automaton's
     current state. This works even if the automaton's stack is empty, in
     which case the current state is an initial state. This number can be
     passed as an argument to a [message] function generated by [menhir
     --compile-errors]. *)

  val current_state_number: 'a env -> int

  (* [equal env1 env2] tells whether the parser configurations [env1] and
     [env2] are equal in the sense that the automaton's current state is the
     same in [env1] and [env2] and the stack is *physically* the same in
     [env1] and [env2]. If [equal env1 env2] is [true], then the sequence of
     the stack elements, as observed via [pop] and [top], must be the same in
     [env1] and [env2]. Also, if [equal env1 env2] holds, then the checkpoints
     [input_needed env1] and [input_needed env2] must be equivalent. The
     function [equal] has time complexity O(1). *)

  val equal: 'a env -> 'a env -> bool

  (* These are the start and end positions of the current lookahead token. If
     invoked in an initial state, this function returns a pair of twice the
     initial position. *)

  val positions: 'a env -> position * position

  (* When applied to an environment taken from a checkpoint of the form
     [AboutToReduce (env, prod)], the function [env_has_default_reduction]
     tells whether the reduction that is about to take place is a default
     reduction. *)

  val env_has_default_reduction: 'a env -> bool

  (* [state_has_default_reduction s] tells whether the state [s] has a default
     reduction. This includes the case where [s] is an accepting state. *)

  val state_has_default_reduction: _ lr1state -> bool

  (* [pop env] returns a new environment, where the parser's top stack cell
     has been popped off. (If the stack is empty, [None] is returned.) This
     amounts to pretending that the (terminal or nonterminal) symbol that
     corresponds to this stack cell has not been read. *)

  val pop: 'a env -> 'a env option

  (* [force_reduction prod env] should be called only if in the state [env]
     the parser is capable of reducing the production [prod]. If this
     condition is satisfied, then this production is reduced, which means that
     its semantic action is executed (this can have side effects!) and the
     automaton makes a goto (nonterminal) transition. If this condition is not
     satisfied, [Invalid_argument _] is raised. *)

  val force_reduction: production -> 'a env -> 'a env

  (* [input_needed env] returns [InputNeeded env]. That is, out of an [env]
     that might have been obtained via a series of calls to the functions
     [pop], [force_reduction], [feed], etc., it produces a checkpoint, which
     can be used to resume normal parsing, by supplying this checkpoint as an
     argument to [offer]. *)

  (* This function should be used with some care. It could "mess up the
     lookahead" in the sense that it allows parsing to resume in an arbitrary
     state [s] with an arbitrary lookahead symbol [t], even though Menhir's
     reachability analysis (menhir --list-errors) might well think that it is
     impossible to reach this particular configuration. If one is using
     Menhir's new error reporting facility, this could cause the parser to
     reach an error state for which no error message has been prepared. *)

(* This file defines several types and module types that are used in the
   specification of module [Engine]. *)

(* --------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* It would be nice if we could keep the structure of stacks and environments
   hidden. However, stacks and environments must be accessible to semantic
   actions, so the following data structure definitions must be public. *)

(* --------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* A stack is a linked list of cells. A sentinel cell -- which is its own
   successor -- is used to mark the bottom of the stack. The sentinel cell
   itself is not significant -- it contains dummy values. *)

type ('state, 'semantic_value) stack = {

  (* The state that we should go back to if we pop this stack cell. *)

  (* This convention means that the state contained in the top stack cell is
     not the current state [env.current]. It also means that the state found
     within the sentinel is a dummy -- it is never consulted. This convention
     is the same as that adopted by the code-based back-end. *)

  state: 'state;

  (* The semantic value associated with the chunk of input that this cell
     represents. *)

  semv: 'semantic_value;

  (* The start and end positions of the chunk of input that this cell
     represents. *)

  startp: Lexing.position;
  endp: Lexing.position;

  (* The next cell down in the stack. If this is a self-pointer, then this
     cell is the sentinel, and the stack is conceptually empty. *)

  next: ('state, 'semantic_value) stack;

}

(* --------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* A parsing environment contains all of the parser's state (except for the
   current program point). *)

type ('state, 'semantic_value, 'token) env = {

  (* If this flag is true, then the first component of [env.triple] should
     be ignored, as it has been logically overwritten with the [error]
     pseudo-token. *)

  error: bool;

  (* The last token that was obtained from the lexer, together with its start
     and end positions. Warning: before the first call to the lexer has taken
     place, a dummy (and possibly invalid) token is stored here. *)

  triple: 'token * Lexing.position * Lexing.position;

  (* The stack. In [CodeBackend], it is passed around on its own,
     whereas, here, it is accessed via the environment. *)

  stack: ('state, 'semantic_value) stack;

  (* The current state. In [CodeBackend], it is passed around on its
     own, whereas, here, it is accessed via the environment. *)

}

(* --------------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* This signature describes the parameters that must be supplied to the LR
   engine. *)

module type TABLE = sig

  (* The type of automaton states. *)

  type state

  (* States are numbered. *)

  val number: state -> int

  (* The type of tokens. These can be thought of as real tokens, that is,
     tokens returned by the lexer. They carry a semantic value. This type
     does not include the [error] pseudo-token. *)

  type token

  (* The type of terminal symbols. These can be thought of as integer codes.
     They do not carry a semantic value. This type does include the [error]
     pseudo-token. *)

  type terminal

  (* The type of nonterminal symbols. *)

  type nonterminal

  (* The type of semantic values. *)

  type semantic_value

  (* A token is conceptually a pair of a (non-[error]) terminal symbol and
     a semantic value. The following two functions are the pair projections. *)

  val token2terminal: token -> terminal
  val token2value: token -> semantic_value

  (* Even though the [error] pseudo-token is not a real token, it is a
     terminal symbol. Furthermore, for regularity, it must have a semantic
     value. *)

  val error_terminal: terminal
  val error_value: semantic_value

  (* [foreach_terminal] allows iterating over all terminal symbols. *)

  val foreach_terminal: (terminal -> 'a -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'a

  (* The type of productions. *)

  type production

  val production_index: production -> int
  val find_production: int -> production

  (* If a state [s] has a default reduction on production [prod], then, upon
     entering [s], the automaton should reduce [prod] without consulting the
     lookahead token. The following function allows determining which states
     have default reductions. *)

  (* Instead of returning a value of a sum type -- either [DefRed prod], or
     [NoDefRed] -- it accepts two continuations, and invokes just one of
     them. This mechanism allows avoiding a memory allocation. *)

  val default_reduction:
    state ->
    ('env -> production -> 'answer) ->
    ('env -> 'answer) ->
    'env -> 'answer

  (* An LR automaton can normally take three kinds of actions: shift, reduce,
     or fail. (Acceptance is a particular case of reduction: it consists in
     reducing a start production.) *)

  (* There are two variants of the shift action. [shift/discard s] instructs
     the automaton to discard the current token, request a new one from the
     lexer, and move to state [s]. [shift/nodiscard s] instructs it to move to
     state [s] without requesting a new token. This instruction should be used
     when [s] has a default reduction on [#]. See [CodeBackend.gettoken] for
     details. *)

  (* This is the automaton's action table. It maps a pair of a state and a
     terminal symbol to an action. *)

  (* Instead of returning a value of a sum type -- one of shift/discard,
     shift/nodiscard, reduce, or fail -- this function accepts three
     continuations, and invokes just one them. This mechanism allows avoiding
     a memory allocation. *)

  (* In summary, the parameters to [action] are as follows:

     - the first two parameters, a state and a terminal symbol, are used to
       look up the action table;

     - the next parameter is the semantic value associated with the above
       terminal symbol; it is not used, only passed along to the shift
       continuation, as explained below;

     - the shift continuation expects an environment; a flag that tells
       whether to discard the current token; the terminal symbol that
       is being shifted; its semantic value; and the target state of
       the transition;

     - the reduce continuation expects an environment and a production;

     - the fail continuation expects an environment;

     - the last parameter is the environment; it is not used, only passed
       along to the selected continuation. *)

  val action:
    state ->
    terminal ->
    semantic_value ->
    ('env -> bool -> terminal -> semantic_value -> state -> 'answer) ->
    ('env -> production -> 'answer) ->
    ('env -> 'answer) ->
    'env -> 'answer

  (* This is the automaton's goto table. This table maps a pair of a state
     and a nonterminal symbol to a new state. By extension, it also maps a
     pair of a state and a production to a new state. *)

  (* The function [goto_nt] can be applied to [s] and [nt] ONLY if the state
     [s] has an outgoing transition labeled [nt]. Otherwise, its result is
     undefined. Similarly, the call [goto_prod prod s] is permitted ONLY if
     the state [s] has an outgoing transition labeled with the nonterminal
     symbol [lhs prod]. The function [maybe_goto_nt] involves an additional
     dynamic check and CAN be called even if there is no outgoing transition. *)

  val       goto_nt  : state -> nonterminal -> state
  val       goto_prod: state -> production  -> state
  val maybe_goto_nt:   state -> nonterminal -> state option

  (* [is_start prod] tells whether the production [prod] is a start production. *)

  val is_start: production -> bool

  (* By convention, a semantic action is responsible for:

     1. fetching whatever semantic values and positions it needs off the stack;

     2. popping an appropriate number of cells off the stack, as dictated
        by the length of the right-hand side of the production;

     3. computing a new semantic value, as well as new start and end positions;

     4. pushing a new stack cell, which contains the three values
        computed in step 3;

     5. returning the new stack computed in steps 2 and 4.

     Point 1 is essentially forced upon us: if semantic values were fetched
     off the stack by this interpreter, then the calling convention for
     semantic actions would be variadic: not all semantic actions would have
     the same number of arguments. The rest follows rather naturally. *)

     is not used by the core LR engine. It is used in the implementation
     of certain functions, such as [force_reduction], which allow the engine
     to be driven programmatically. *)

   back-end will publish specialized versions of it, with a suitable
   type cast. *)

  (* [start] is an entry point. It requires a start state and a start position
     and begins the parsing process. If the lexer is based on an OCaml lexing

     a checkpoint, which usually will be an [InputNeeded] checkpoint. (It could

(* This signature defines the format of the parse tables. It is used as
   an argument to [TableInterpreter.Make]. *)

module type TABLES = sig

  (* This is the parser's type of tokens. *)

  type token

  (* This maps a token to its internal (generation-time) integer code. *)

  val token2terminal: token -> int

  (* This is the integer code for the error pseudo-token. *)

  val error_terminal: int

  (* This maps a token to its semantic value. *)

  val token2value: token -> Obj.t

  (* Traditionally, an LR automaton is described by two tables, namely, an
     action table and a goto table. See, for instance, the Dragon book.

     The action table is a two-dimensional matrix that maps a state and a
     lookahead token to an action. An action is one of: shift to a certain
     state, reduce a certain production, accept, or fail.

     The goto table is a two-dimensional matrix that maps a state and a
     non-terminal symbol to either a state or undefined. By construction, this
     table is sparse: its undefined entries are never looked up. A compression
     technique is free to overlap them with other entries.

     In Menhir, things are slightly different. If a state has a default
     reduction on token [#], then that reduction must be performed without
     consulting the lookahead token. As a result, we must first determine
     whether that is the case, before we can obtain a lookahead token and use it
     as an index in the action table.

     Thus, Menhir's tables are as follows.

     A one-dimensional default reduction table maps a state to either ``no
     default reduction'' (encoded as: 0) or ``by default, reduce prod''
     (encoded as: 1 + prod). The action table is looked up only when there
     is no default reduction. *)

  val default_reduction: PackedIntArray.t

  (* Menhir follows Dencker, Dürre and Heuft, who point out that, although the
     action table is not sparse by nature (i.e., the error entries are
     significant), it can be made sparse by first factoring out a binary error
     matrix, then replacing the error entries in the action table with undefined
     entries. Thus:

     A two-dimensional error bitmap maps a state and a terminal to either
     ``fail'' (encoded as: 0) or ``do not fail'' (encoded as: 1). The action
     table, which is now sparse, is looked up only in the latter case. *)

  (* The error bitmap is flattened into a one-dimensional table; its width is
     recorded so as to allow indexing. The table is then compressed via
     [PackedIntArray]. The bit width of the resulting packed array must be
     [1], so it is not explicitly recorded. *)

  (* The error bitmap does not contain a column for the [#] pseudo-terminal.
     Thus, its width is [Terminal.n - 1]. We exploit the fact that the integer
     code assigned to [#] is greatest: the fact that the right-most column
     in the bitmap is missing does not affect the code for accessing it. *)

  val error: int (* width of the bitmap *) * string (* second component of [PackedIntArray.t] *)

  (* A two-dimensional action table maps a state and a terminal to one of
     ``shift to state s and discard the current token'' (encoded as: s | 10),
     ``shift to state s without discarding the current token'' (encoded as: s |
     11), or ``reduce prod'' (encoded as: prod | 01). *)

  (* The action table is first compressed via [RowDisplacement], then packed
     via [PackedIntArray]. *)

  (* Like the error bitmap, the action table does not contain a column for the
     [#] pseudo-terminal. *)

  val action: PackedIntArray.t * PackedIntArray.t

  (* A one-dimensional lhs table maps a production to its left-hand side (a
     non-terminal symbol). *)

  val lhs: PackedIntArray.t

  (* A two-dimensional goto table maps a state and a non-terminal symbol to
     either undefined (encoded as: 0) or a new state s (encoded as: 1 + s). *)

  (* The goto table is first compressed via [RowDisplacement], then packed
     via [PackedIntArray]. *)

  val goto: PackedIntArray.t * PackedIntArray.t

  (* The number of start productions. A production [prod] is a start
     production if and only if [prod < start] holds. This is also the
     number of start symbols. A nonterminal symbol [nt] is a start
     symbol if and only if [nt < start] holds. *)

  val start: int

  (* A one-dimensional semantic action table maps productions to semantic
     actions. The calling convention for semantic actions is described in
     [EngineTypes]. This table contains ONLY NON-START PRODUCTIONS, so the
     indexing is off by [start]. Be careful. *)

  val semantic_action: ((int, Obj.t, token) EngineTypes.env ->
                        (int, Obj.t)        EngineTypes.stack) array

  (* The parser defines its own [Error] exception. This exception can be
     raised by semantic actions and caught by the engine, and raised by the
     engine towards the final user. *)

  exception Error

  (* The parser indicates whether to generate a trace. Generating a
     trace requires two extra tables, which respectively map a
     terminal symbol and a production to a string. *)

(* This module provides a thin decoding layer for the generated tables, thus
   providing an API that is suitable for use by [Engine.Make]. It is part of
   [MenhirLib]. *)

(* The exception [Error] is declared within the generated parser. This is
   preferable to pre-declaring it here, as it ensures that each parser gets
   its own, distinct [Error] exception. This is consistent with the code-based
   back-end. *)

(* This functor is invoked by the generated parser. *)
