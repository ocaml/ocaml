(** MD5 message digest.

   This module provides functions to compute 128-bit 'digests' of
   arbitrary-length strings or files. The digests are of cryptographic
   quality: it is very hard, given a digest, to forge a string having
   that digest. The algorithm used is MD5. This module should not be
   used for secure and sensitive cryptographic applications. For these
   kind of applications more recent and stronger cryptographic
   primitives should be used instead.
*)

type t = string
(** The type of digests: 16-character strings. *)

val compare : t -> t -> int
(** The comparison function for 16-character digest, with the same
    specification as {!Pervasives.compare} and the implementation
    shared with {!String.compare}. Along with the type [t], this
    function [compare] allows the module [Digest] to be passed as
    argument to the functors {!Set.Make} and {!Map.Make}.
    @since 4.00.0 *)

val string : string -> t
(** Return the digest of the given string. *)

val bytes : bytes -> t
(** Return the digest of the given byte sequence. *)

val substring : string -> int -> int -> t
(** [Digest.substring s ofs len] returns the digest of the substring
   of [s] starting at index [ofs] and containing [len] characters. *)

val subbytes : bytes -> int -> int -> t
(** [Digest.subbytes s ofs len] returns the digest of the subsequence
   of [s] starting at index [ofs] and containing [len] bytes. *)

external channel : in_channel -> int -> t = "caml_md5_chan"
(** If [len] is nonnegative, [Digest.channel ic len] reads [len]
   characters from channel [ic] and returns their digest, or raises
   [End_of_file] if end-of-file is reached before [len] characters
   are read.  If [len] is negative, [Digest.channel ic len] reads
   all characters from [ic] until end-of-file is reached and return
   their digest. *)

val file : string -> t
(** Return the digest of the file whose name is given. *)

val output : out_channel -> t -> unit
(** Write a digest on the given output channel. *)

val input : in_channel -> t
(** Read a digest from the given input channel. *)

val to_hex : t -> string
(** Return the printable hexadecimal representation of the given digest. *)

val from_hex : string -> t
(** Convert a hexadecimal representation back into the corresponding digest.
   Raise [Invalid_argument] if the argument is not exactly 32 hexadecimal
   characters.
