(** Processor-native integers.

   This module provides operations on the type [nativeint] of
   signed 32-bit integers (on 32-bit platforms) or
   signed 64-bit integers (on 64-bit platforms).
   This integer type has exactly the same width as that of a
   pointer type in the C compiler.  All arithmetic operations over
   [nativeint] are taken modulo 2{^32} or 2{^64} depending
   on the word size of the architecture.

   Performance notice: values of type [nativeint] occupy more memory
   space than values of type [int], and arithmetic operations on
   [nativeint] are generally slower than those on [int].  Use [nativeint]
   only when the application requires the extra bit of precision
   over the [int] type.

    Literals for native integers are suffixed by n:
    {[
     let zero: nativeint = 0n
     let one: nativeint = 1n
     let m_one: nativeint = -1n
    ]}
*)

   [x = Nativeint.add (Nativeint.mul (Nativeint.div x y) y)
                      (Nativeint.rem x y)].
   If [y = 0], [Nativeint.rem x y] raises [Division_by_zero]. *)

external shift_right : nativeint -> int -> nativeint = "%nativeint_asr"
(** [Nativeint.shift_right x y] shifts [x] to the right by [y] bits.

external shift_right_logical :
  nativeint -> int -> nativeint = "%nativeint_lsr"
(** [Nativeint.shift_right_logical x y] shifts [x] to the right

   regardless of the sign of [x].
   The result is unspecified if [y < 0] or [y >= bitsize]. *)

external to_int32 : nativeint -> int32 = "%nativeint_to_int32"
(** Convert the given native integer to a
   32-bit integer (type [int32]).  On 64-bit platforms,
   the 64-bit native integer is taken modulo 2{^32},
   i.e. the top 32 bits are lost.  On 32-bit platforms,
   the conversion is exact. *)

external of_string : string -> nativeint = "caml_nativeint_of_string"
(** Convert the given string to a native integer.
   The string is read in decimal (by default, or if the string
   begins with [0u]) or in hexadecimal, octal or binary if the
   string begins with [0x], [0o] or [0b] respectively.

   The [0u] prefix reads the input as an unsigned integer in the range
   [[0, 2*Nativeint.max_int+1]].  If the input exceeds {!Nativeint.max_int}
   it is converted to the signed integer
   [Int64.min_int + input - Nativeint.max_int - 1].
