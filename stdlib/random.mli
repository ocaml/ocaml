(** Pseudo-random number generators (PRNG).

    With multiple domains, each domain has its own generator that evolves
    independently of the generators of other domains.  When a domain is
    created, its generator is initialized by splitting the state
    of the generator associated with the parent domain.

    In contrast, all threads within a domain share the same domain-local
    generator.  Independent generators can be created with the {!Random.split}
    function and used with the functions from the {!Random.State} module.
*)

(** {1 Basic functions} *)

val init : int -> unit
(** Initialize the domain-local generator, using the argument as a seed.
    The same seed will always yield the same sequence of numbers. *)

val full_init : int array -> unit
(** Same as {!Random.init} but takes more data as seed. *)

val self_init : unit -> unit
(** Initialize the domain-local generator with a random seed chosen
    in a system-dependent way.  If [/dev/urandom] is available on the host
    machine, it is used to provide a highly random initial seed.  Otherwise, a
    less random seed is computed from system parameters (current time, process
    IDs, domain-local state). *)

val bits : unit -> int
(** Return 30 random bits in a nonnegative integer.
    @before 5.0 used a different algorithm (affects all the following functions)
*)

val int : int -> int
(** [Random.int bound] returns a random integer between 0 (inclusive)
     and [bound] (exclusive).  [bound] must be greater than 0 and less
     than 2{^30}. *)

val full_int : int -> int
(** [Random.full_int bound] returns a random integer between 0 (inclusive)
     and [bound] (exclusive). [bound] may be any positive integer.

     If [bound] is less than 2{^30}, [Random.full_int bound] is equal to
     {!Random.int}[ bound]. If [bound] is greater than 2{^30} (on 64-bit systems
     or non-standard environments, such as JavaScript), [Random.full_int]
     returns a value, where {!Random.int} raises {!Stdlib.Invalid_argument}.

    @since 4.13 *)

val int32 : Int32.t -> Int32.t
(** [Random.int32 bound] returns a random integer between 0 (inclusive)
     and [bound] (exclusive).  [bound] must be greater than 0. *)

val nativeint : Nativeint.t -> Nativeint.t
(** [Random.nativeint bound] returns a random integer between 0 (inclusive)
     and [bound] (exclusive).  [bound] must be greater than 0. *)

val int64 : Int64.t -> Int64.t
(** [Random.int64 bound] returns a random integer between 0 (inclusive)
     and [bound] (exclusive).  [bound] must be greater than 0. *)

val float : float -> float
(** [Random.float bound] returns a random floating-point number
   between 0 and [bound] (inclusive).  If [bound] is
   negative, the result is negative or zero.  If [bound] is 0,
   the result is 0. *)

val bool : unit -> bool
(** [Random.bool ()] returns [true] or [false] with probability 0.5 each. *)

val bits32 : unit -> Int32.t
(** [Random.bits32 ()] returns 32 random bits as an integer between
    {!Int32.min_int} and {!Int32.max_int}.
    @since 4.14 *)

val bits64 : unit -> Int64.t
(** [Random.bits64 ()] returns 64 random bits as an integer between
    {!Int64.min_int} and {!Int64.max_int}.
    @since 4.14 *)

val nativebits : unit -> Nativeint.t
(** [Random.nativebits ()] returns 32 or 64 random bits (depending on
    the bit width of the platform) as an integer between
    {!Nativeint.min_int} and {!Nativeint.max_int}.
    @since 4.14 *)

(** {1 Advanced functions} *)

(** The functions from module {!State} manipulate the current state
    of the random generator explicitly.
    This allows using one or several deterministic PRNGs,
    even in a multi-threaded program, without interference from
    other parts of the program.

module State : sig
  type t

  (** Create a new state and initialize it with the given seed. *)

  val make_self_init : unit -> t
  (** Create a new state and initialize it with a random seed chosen
      in a system-dependent way.
      The seed is obtained as described in {!Random.self_init}. *)

  val copy : t -> t
  (** Return a copy of the given state. *)

  val bits : t -> int
  val int : t -> int -> int
  val full_int : t -> int -> int

      use (and update) the given PRNG state instead of the default one.
  *)

  val split : t -> t
  (** Draw a fresh PRNG state from the given PRNG state.
      (The given PRNG state is modified.)
      The new PRNG is statistically independent from the given PRNG.
      Data can be drawn from both PRNGs, in any order, without risk of
      correlation.  Both PRNGs can be split later, arbitrarily many times.

  val to_binary_string : t -> string
  (** Serializes the PRNG state into an immutable sequence of bytes.
      See {!of_binary_string} for deserialization.

      The [string] type is intended here for serialization only, the
      encoding is not human-readable and may not be printable.

      Note that the serialization format may differ across OCaml
      versions.

      @since 5.1
  *)

  val of_binary_string : string -> t
  (** Deserializes a byte sequence obtained by calling
      {!to_binary_string}. The resulting PRNG state will produce the
      same random numbers as the state that was passed as input to
      {!to_binary_string}.

      @raise Failure if the input is not in the expected format.

      Note that the serialization format may differ across OCaml
      versions.

      Unlike the functions provided by the {!Marshal} module, this
      function either produces a valid state or fails cleanly with
      a [Failure] exception. It can be safely used on user-provided,
      untrusted inputs.

    generator (which is used by the basic functions) by copying
    the state [s] into it. *)

val split : unit -> State.t

    generator used by the default functions.
    (The state of the domain-local generator is modified.)
