(** Pretty-printing.

   This module implements a pretty-printing facility to format values
   within {{!boxes}'pretty-printing boxes'} and {{!tags}'semantic tags'}
   combined with a set of {{!fpp}printf-like functions}.
   The pretty-printer splits lines at specified {{!breaks}break hints},
   and indents lines according to the box structure.
   Similarly, {{!tags}semantic tags} can be used to decouple text
   presentation from its contents.

   This pretty-printing facility is implemented as an overlay on top of
   abstract {{!section:formatter}formatters} which provide basic output
   functions.
   Some formatters are predefined, notably:
   - {!std_formatter} outputs to {{!Stdlib.stdout}stdout}
   - {!err_formatter} outputs to {{!Stdlib.stderr}stderr}

   Most functions in the {!Format} module come in two variants:
   a short version that operates on {!std_formatter} and the
   generic version prefixed by [pp_] that takes a formatter
   as its first argument.

   More formatters can be created with {!formatter_of_out_channel},
   {!formatter_of_buffer}, {!formatter_of_symbolic_output_buffer}
   or using {{!section:formatter}custom formatters}.

*)

(** {1 Introduction}
   For a gentle introduction to the basics of pretty-printing using
   [Format], read
   {{:http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/format.en.html}
    http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/format.en.html}.

   You may consider this module as providing an extension to the
   [printf] facility to provide automatic line splitting. The addition of
   pretty-printing annotations to your regular [printf] format strings gives
   you fancy indentation and line breaks.
   Pretty-printing annotations are described below in the documentation of
   the function {!Format.fprintf}.

   You may also use the explicit pretty-printing box management and printing
   functions provided by this module. This style is more basic but more
   verbose than the concise [fprintf] format strings.

   For instance, the sequence
   [open_box 0; print_string "x ="; print_space ();
    print_int 1; close_box (); print_newline ()]
   that prints [x = 1] within a pretty-printing box, can be
   abbreviated as [printf "@[%s@ %i@]@." "x =" 1], or even shorter
   [printf "@[x =@ %i@]@." 1].

   Rule of thumb for casual users of this library:
 - use simple pretty-printing boxes (as obtained by [open_box 0]);
 - use simple break hints as obtained by [print_cut ()] that outputs a
   simple break hint, or by [print_space ()] that outputs a space
   indicating a break hint;
 - once a pretty-printing box is open, display its material with basic
   printing functions (e. g. [print_int] and [print_string]);
 - when the material for a pretty-printing box has been printed, call
   [close_box ()] to close the box;
 - at the end of pretty-printing, flush the pretty-printer to display all
   the remaining material, e.g. evaluate [print_newline ()].

   The behavior of pretty-printing commands is unspecified
   if there is no open pretty-printing box. Each box opened by
   one of the [open_] functions below must be closed using [close_box]
   for proper formatting. Otherwise, some of the material printed in the
   boxes may not be output, or may be formatted incorrectly.

   In case of interactive use, each phrase is executed in the initial state
   of the standard pretty-printer: after each phrase execution, the
   interactive system closes all open pretty-printing boxes, flushes all
   pending text, and resets the standard pretty-printer.

   Warning: mixing calls to pretty-printing functions of this module with
   calls to {!Stdlib} low level output functions is error prone.

   The pretty-printing functions output material that is delayed in the
   pretty-printer queue and stacks in order to compute proper line
   splitting. In contrast, basic I/O output functions write directly in
   their output device. As a consequence, the output of a basic I/O function
   may appear before the output of a pretty-printing function that has been
   called before. For instance,
   [
    Stdlib.print_string "<";
    Format.print_string "PRETTY";
    Stdlib.print_string ">";
    Format.print_string "TEXT";
   ]
   leads to output [<>PRETTYTEXT].

type formatter
(** Abstract data corresponding to a pretty-printer (also called a
    formatter) and all its machinery. See also {!section:formatter}. *)

(** {1:boxes Pretty-printing boxes} *)

(** The pretty-printing engine uses the concepts of pretty-printing box and
  break hint to drive indentation and line splitting behavior of the
  pretty-printer.

  Each different pretty-printing box kind introduces a specific line splitting
  policy:

  - within an {e horizontal} box, break hints never split the line (but the
    line may be split in a box nested deeper),
  - within a {e vertical} box, break hints always split the line,
  - within an {e horizontal/vertical} box, if the box fits on the current line
    then break hints never split the line, otherwise break hint always split
    the line,
  - within a {e compacting} box, a break hint never splits the line,
    unless there is no more room on the current line.

  Note that line splitting policy is box specific: the policy of a box does
  not rule the policy of inner boxes. For instance, if a vertical box is
  nested in an horizontal box, all break hints within the vertical box will
  split the line.

  Moreover, opening a box after the {{!maxindent}maximum indentation limit}
  splits the line whether or not the box would end up fitting on the line.

*)

val pp_open_box : formatter -> int -> unit
val open_box : int -> unit
(** [pp_open_box ppf d] opens a new compacting pretty-printing box with
    offset [d] in the formatter [ppf].

   Within this box, the pretty-printer prints as much as possible material on
   every line.

   A break hint splits the line if there is no more room on the line to
   print the remainder of the box.

   Within this box, the pretty-printer emphasizes the box structure:
   if a structural box does not fit fully on a simple line, a break
   hint also splits the line if the splitting ``moves to the left''
   (i.e. the new line gets an indentation smaller than the one of the current
   line).

   This box is the general purpose pretty-printing box.

   If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, offset [d] is added to
   the current indentation.

val pp_close_box : formatter -> unit -> unit
val close_box : unit -> unit
(** Closes the most recently open pretty-printing box. *)

val pp_open_hbox : formatter -> unit -> unit
val open_hbox : unit -> unit
(** [pp_open_hbox ppf ()] opens a new 'horizontal' pretty-printing box.

  This box prints material on a single line.

  Break hints in a horizontal box never split the line.
  (Line splitting may still occur inside boxes nested deeper).
*)

val pp_open_vbox : formatter -> int -> unit
val open_vbox : int -> unit
(** [pp_open_vbox ppf d] opens a new 'vertical' pretty-printing box
  with offset [d].

  This box prints material on as many lines as break hints in the box.

  Every break hint in a vertical box splits the line.

  If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, [d] is added to the
  current indentation.
*)

val pp_open_hvbox : formatter -> int -> unit
val open_hvbox : int -> unit
(** [pp_open_hvbox ppf d] opens a new 'horizontal/vertical' pretty-printing box
  with offset [d].

  This box behaves as an horizontal box if it fits on a single line,
  otherwise it behaves as a vertical box.

  If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, [d] is added to the
  current indentation.
*)

val pp_open_hovbox : formatter -> int -> unit
val open_hovbox : int -> unit
(** [pp_open_hovbox ppf d] opens a new 'horizontal-or-vertical'
  pretty-printing box with offset [d].

  This box prints material as much as possible on every line.

  A break hint splits the line if there is no more room on the line to
  print the remainder of the box.

  If the pretty-printer splits the line in the box, [d] is added to the
  current indentation.
*)

(** {1 Formatting functions} *)

val pp_print_string : formatter -> string -> unit
val print_string : string -> unit
(** [pp_print_string ppf s] prints [s] in the current pretty-printing box. *)

val pp_print_as : formatter -> int -> string -> unit
val print_as : int -> string -> unit
(** [pp_print_as ppf len s] prints [s] in the current pretty-printing box.
  The pretty-printer formats [s] as if it were of length [len].
*)

val pp_print_int : formatter -> int -> unit
val print_int : int -> unit
(** Print an integer in the current pretty-printing box. *)

val pp_print_float : formatter -> float -> unit
val print_float : float -> unit
(** Print a floating point number in the current pretty-printing box. *)

val pp_print_char : formatter -> char -> unit
val print_char : char -> unit
(** Print a character in the current pretty-printing box. *)

val pp_print_bool : formatter -> bool -> unit
val print_bool : bool -> unit
(** Print a boolean in the current pretty-printing box. *)

(** {1:breaks Break hints} *)

(** A 'break hint' tells the pretty-printer to output some space or split the
  line whichever way is more appropriate to the current pretty-printing box
  splitting rules.

  Break hints are used to separate printing items and are mandatory to let
  the pretty-printer correctly split lines and indent items.

  Simple break hints are:
  - the 'space': output a space or split the line if appropriate,
  - the 'cut': split the line if appropriate.

  Note: the notions of space and line splitting are abstract for the
  pretty-printing engine, since those notions can be completely redefined
  by the programmer.
  However, in the pretty-printer default setting, ``output a space'' simply
  means printing a space character (ASCII code 32) and ``split the line''
  means printing a newline character (ASCII code 10).
*)

val pp_print_space : formatter -> unit -> unit
val print_space : unit -> unit
(** [pp_print_space ppf ()] emits a 'space' break hint:
  the pretty-printer may split the line at this point,
  otherwise it prints one space.

  [pp_print_space ppf ()] is equivalent to [pp_print_break ppf 1 0].
*)

val pp_print_cut : formatter -> unit -> unit
val print_cut : unit -> unit
(** [pp_print_cut ppf ()] emits a 'cut' break hint:
  the pretty-printer may split the line at this point,
  otherwise it prints nothing.

  [pp_print_cut ppf ()] is equivalent to [pp_print_break ppf 0 0].
*)

val pp_print_break : formatter -> int -> int -> unit
val print_break : int -> int -> unit
(** [pp_print_break ppf nspaces offset] emits a 'full' break hint:
  the pretty-printer may split the line at this point,
  otherwise it prints [nspaces] spaces.

  If the pretty-printer splits the line, [offset] is added to
  the current indentation.
*)

val pp_print_custom_break :
  formatter ->
  fits:(string * int * string) ->
  breaks:(string * int * string) ->
  unit
(** [pp_print_custom_break ppf ~fits:(s1, n, s2) ~breaks:(s3, m, s4)] emits a
   custom break hint: the pretty-printer may split the line at this point.

   If it does not split the line, then the [s1] is emitted, then [n] spaces,
   then [s2].

   If it splits the line, then it emits the [s3] string, then an indent
   (according to the box rules), then an offset of [m] spaces, then the [s4]
   string.

   While [n] and [m] are handled by [formatter_out_functions.out_indent], the
   strings will be handled by [formatter_out_functions.out_string]. This allows
   for a custom formatter that handles indentation distinctly, for example,
   outputs [<br/>] tags or [&nbsp;] entities.

   The custom break is useful if you want to change which visible
   (non-whitespace) characters are printed in case of break or no break. For
   example, when printing a list {[ [a; b; c] ]}, you might want to add a
   trailing semicolon when it is printed vertically:

   {[
[
  a;
  b;
  c;
]
   ]}

   You can do this as follows:
   {[
printf "@[<v 0>[@;<0 2>@[<v 0>a;@,b;@,c@]%t]@]@\n"
  (pp_print_custom_break ~fits:("", 0, "") ~breaks:(";", 0, ""))
   ]}

val pp_force_newline : formatter -> unit -> unit
val force_newline : unit -> unit
(** Force a new line in the current pretty-printing box.

  The pretty-printer must split the line at this point,

  Not the normal way of pretty-printing, since imperative line splitting may
  interfere with current line counters and box size calculation.
  Using break hints within an enclosing vertical box is a better
  alternative.
*)

val pp_print_if_newline : formatter -> unit -> unit
val print_if_newline : unit -> unit
(** Execute the next formatting command if the preceding line
  has just been split. Otherwise, ignore the next formatting
  command.
*)

(** {1 Pretty-printing termination} *)

val pp_print_flush : formatter -> unit -> unit
val print_flush : unit -> unit
(** End of pretty-printing: resets the pretty-printer to initial state.

  All open pretty-printing boxes are closed, all pending text is printed.
  In addition, the pretty-printer low level output device is flushed to
  ensure that all pending text is really displayed.

  Note: never use [print_flush] in the normal course of a pretty-printing
  routine, since the pretty-printer uses a complex buffering machinery to
  properly indent the output; manually flushing those buffers at random
  would conflict with the pretty-printer strategy and result to poor
  rendering.

  Only consider using [print_flush] when displaying all pending material is
  mandatory (for instance in case of interactive use when you want the user
  to read some text) and when resetting the pretty-printer state will not
  disturb further pretty-printing.

  Warning: If the output device of the pretty-printer is an output channel,
  repeated calls to [print_flush] means repeated calls to {!Stdlib.flush}
  to flush the out channel; these explicit flush calls could foil the
  buffering strategy of output channels and could dramatically impact
  efficiency.
*)

val pp_print_newline : formatter -> unit -> unit
val print_newline : unit -> unit
(** End of pretty-printing: resets the pretty-printer to initial state.

  All open pretty-printing boxes are closed, all pending text is printed.

  Equivalent to {!print_flush} followed by a new line.
  See corresponding words of caution for {!print_flush}.

  Note: this is not the normal way to output a new line;
  the preferred method is using break hints within a vertical pretty-printing
  box.
*)

(** {1 Margin} *)

val pp_set_margin : formatter -> int -> unit
val set_margin : int -> unit
(** [pp_set_margin ppf d] sets the right margin to [d] (in characters):
  the pretty-printer splits lines that overflow the right margin according to
  the break hints given.
  Setting the margin to [d] means that the formatting engine aims at
  printing at most [d-1] characters per line.
  Nothing happens if [d] is smaller than 2.
  If [d] is too large, the right margin is set to the maximum
  admissible value (which is greater than [10 ^ 9]).
  If [d] is less than the current maximum indentation limit, the
  maximum indentation limit is decreased while trying to preserve
  a minimal ratio [max_indent/margin>=50%] and if possible
  the current difference [margin - max_indent].

  See also {!pp_set_geometry}.
*)

val pp_get_margin : formatter -> unit -> int
val get_margin : unit -> int
(** Returns the position of the right margin. *)

(** {1:maxindent Maximum indentation limit} *)

val pp_set_max_indent : formatter -> int -> unit
val set_max_indent : int -> unit
(** [pp_set_max_indent ppf d] sets the maximum indentation limit of lines
  to [d] (in characters):
  once this limit is reached, new pretty-printing boxes are rejected to the
  left, unless the enclosing box fully fits on the current line.
  As an illustration,
  {[ set_margin 10; set_max_indent 5; printf "@[123456@[7@]89A@]@." ]}
  yields
  {[
    123456
    789A
  ]}
  because the nested box ["@[7@]"] is opened after the maximum indentation
  limit ([7>5]) and its parent box does not fit on the current line.
  Either decreasing the length of the parent box to make it fit on a line:
  {[ printf "@[123456@[7@]89@]@." ]}
  or opening an intermediary box before the maximum indentation limit which
  fits on the current line
  {[ printf "@[123@[456@[7@]89@]A@]@." ]}
  avoids the rejection to the left of the inner boxes and print respectively
  ["123456789"] and ["123456789A"] .
  Note also that vertical boxes never fit on a line whereas horizontal boxes
  always fully fit on the current line.
  Opening a box may split a line whereas the contents may have fit.
  If this behavior is problematic, it can be curtailed by setting the maximum
  indentation limit to [margin - 1]. Note that setting the maximum indentation
  limit to [margin] is invalid.

  Nothing happens if [d] is smaller than 2.

  If [d] is too large, the limit is set to the maximum
  admissible value (which is greater than [10 ^ 9]).

  If [d] is greater or equal than the current margin, it is ignored,
  and the current maximum indentation limit is kept.

  See also {!pp_set_geometry}.

   [pp_set_geometry ppf ~max_indent ~margin]
   is equivalent to

  A {e tabulation box} prints material on lines divided into cells of fixed

  This box features command [set_tab] to define cell boundaries, and command
  [print_tab] to move from cell to cell and split the line when there is no
  more cells to print on the line.

  Note: printing within tabulation box is line directed, so arbitrary line
  splitting inside a tabulation box leads to poor rendering. Yet, controlled

(** {1:tags Semantic tags} *)

type stag = ..
(** {i Semantic tags} (or simply {e tags}) are user's defined annotations
  to associate user's specific operations to printed entities.

  Common usage of semantic tags is text decoration to get specific font or
  text size rendering for a display device, or marking delimitation of
  entities (e.g. HTML or TeX elements or terminal escape sequences).
  More sophisticated usage of semantic tags could handle dynamic
  modification of the pretty-printer behavior to properly print the material
  within some specific tags.
  For instance, we can define an RGB tag like so:
{[
type stag += RGB of {r:int;g:int;b:int}
]}

  In order to properly delimit printed entities, a semantic tag must be
  opened before and closed after the entity. Semantic tags must be properly
  nested like parentheses using {!pp_open_stag} and {!pp_close_stag}.

  Tag specific operations occur any time a tag is opened or closed, At each
  occurrence, two kinds of operations are performed {e tag-marking} and
  {e tag-printing}:
- The tag-marking operation is the simpler tag specific operation: it simply
  writes a tag specific string into the output device of the
  formatter. Tag-marking does not interfere with line-splitting computation.
- The tag-printing operation is the more involved tag specific operation: it
  can print arbitrary material to the formatter. Tag-printing is tightly
  linked to the current pretty-printer operations.

  Roughly speaking, tag-marking is commonly used to get a better rendering of
  texts in the rendering device, while tag-printing allows fine tuning of
  printing routines to print the same entity differently according to the
  semantic tags (i.e. print additional material or even omit parts of the
  output).

  More precisely: when a semantic tag is opened or closed then both and
  successive 'tag-printing' and 'tag-marking' operations occur:
  - Tag-printing a semantic tag means calling the formatter specific function
  [print_open_stag] (resp. [print_close_stag]) with the name of the tag as
  argument: that tag-printing function can then print any regular material
  to the formatter (so that this material is enqueued as usual in the
  formatter queue for further line splitting computation).
  - Tag-marking a semantic tag means calling the formatter specific function
  [mark_open_stag] (resp. [mark_close_stag]) with the name of the tag as
  argument: that tag-marking function can then return the 'tag-opening
  marker' (resp. `tag-closing marker') for direct output into the output
  device of the formatter.

  Being written directly into the output device of the formatter, semantic
  tag marker strings are not considered as part of the printing material that
  drives line splitting (in other words, the length of the strings
  corresponding to tag markers is considered as zero for line splitting).

  Thus, semantic tag handling is in some sense transparent to pretty-printing
  and does not interfere with usual indentation. Hence, a single
  pretty-printing routine can output both simple 'verbatim' material or
  richer decorated output depending on the treatment of tags. By default,
  tags are not active, hence the output is not decorated with tag
  information. Once [set_tags] is set to [true], the pretty-printer engine
  honors tags and decorates the output accordingly.

  Default tag-marking functions behave the HTML way: {{!tag}string tags} are
  enclosed in "<" and ">" while other tags are ignored;
  hence, opening marker for tag string ["t"] is ["<t>"] and closing marker
  is ["</t>"].

  Default tag-printing functions just do nothing.

  Tag-marking and tag-printing functions are user definable and can
  be set by calling {!set_formatter_stag_functions}.

  Semantic tag operations may be set on or off with {!set_tags}.
  Tag-marking operations may be set on or off with {!set_mark_tags}.
  Tag-printing operations may be set on or off with {!set_print_tags}.

(** {1:fpp Formatted pretty-printing} *)

(**
  Module [Format] provides a complete set of [printf] like functions for
  pretty-printing using format string specifications.

  Specific annotations may be added in the format strings to give
  pretty-printing commands to the pretty-printing engine.

  [@\[] opens a new box, and [@\]] closes the last open box.

(** [fprintf ff fmt arg1 ... argN] formats the arguments [arg1] to [argN]
  according to the format string [fmt], and outputs the resulting string on
  the formatter [ff].

  The format string [fmt] is a character string which contains three types of
  objects: plain characters and conversion specifications as specified in
  the {!Printf} module, and pretty-printing indications specific to the
  [Format] module.

  The pretty-printing indication characters are introduced by
  a [@] character, and their meanings are:
  - [@\[]: open a pretty-printing box. The type and offset of the
    box may be optionally specified with the following syntax:
    the [<] character, followed by an optional box type indication,
    then an optional integer offset, and the closing [>] character.
    Pretty-printing box type is one of [h], [v], [hv], [b], or [hov].
    '[h]' stands for an 'horizontal' pretty-printing box,
    '[v]' stands for a 'vertical' pretty-printing box,
    '[hv]' stands for an 'horizontal/vertical' pretty-printing box,
    '[b]' stands for an 'horizontal-or-vertical' pretty-printing box
    demonstrating indentation,
    '[hov]' stands a simple 'horizontal-or-vertical' pretty-printing box.
    For instance, [@\[<hov 2>] opens an 'horizontal-or-vertical'
    pretty-printing box with indentation 2 as obtained with [open_hovbox 2].
    For more details about pretty-printing boxes, see the various box opening
    functions [open_*box].
  - [@\]]: close the most recently opened pretty-printing box.
  - [@,]: output a 'cut' break hint, as with [print_cut ()].
  - [@ ]: output a 'space' break hint, as with [print_space ()].
  - [@;]: output a 'full' break hint as with [print_break]. The
    [nspaces] and [offset] parameters of the break hint may be
    optionally specified with the following syntax:
    the [<] character, followed by an integer [nspaces] value,
    then an integer [offset], and a closing [>] character.
    If no parameters are provided, the good break defaults to a
    'space' break hint.
  - [@.]: flush the pretty-printer and split the line, as with
    [print_newline ()].
  - [@<n>]: print the following item as if it were of length [n].
    Hence, [printf "@<0>%s" arg] prints [arg] as a zero length string.
    If [@<n>] is not followed by a conversion specification,
    then the following character of the format is printed as if
    it were of length [n].
  - [@\{]: open a semantic tag. The name of the tag may be optionally
    specified with the following syntax:
    the [<] character, followed by an optional string
    specification, and the closing [>] character. The string
    specification is any character string that does not contain the
    closing character ['>']. If omitted, the tag name defaults to the
    empty string.
    For more details about semantic tags, see the functions {!open_stag} and
    {!close_stag}.
  - [@\}]: close the most recently opened semantic tag.
  - [@?]: flush the pretty-printer as with [print_flush ()].
    This is equivalent to the conversion [%!].
  - [@\n]: force a newline, as with [force_newline ()], not the normal way
    of pretty-printing, you should prefer using break hints inside a vertical
    pretty-printing box.

  Note: To prevent the interpretation of a [@] character as a
  pretty-printing indication, escape it with a [%] character.
  Old quotation mode [@@] is deprecated since it is not compatible with
  formatted input interpretation of character ['@'].

  Example: [printf "@[%s@ %d@]@." "x =" 1] is equivalent to
  [open_box (); print_string "x ="; print_space ();
   print_int 1; close_box (); print_newline ()].
  It prints [x = 1] within a pretty-printing 'horizontal-or-vertical' box.
