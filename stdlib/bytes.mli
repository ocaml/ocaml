(** Byte sequence operations.

   A byte sequence is a mutable data structure that contains a
   fixed-length sequence of bytes. Each byte can be indexed in
   constant time for reading or writing.

   Given a byte sequence [s] of length [l], we can access each of the
   [l] bytes of [s] via its index in the sequence. Indexes start at
   [0], and we will call an index valid in [s] if it falls within the
   range [[0...l-1]] (inclusive). A position is the point between two
   bytes or at the beginning or end of the sequence.  We call a
   position valid in [s] if it falls within the range [[0...l]]
   (inclusive). Note that the byte at index [n] is between positions
   [n] and [n+1].

   Two parameters [start] and [len] are said to designate a valid
   range of [s] if [len >= 0] and [start] and [start+len] are valid
   positions in [s].

   Byte sequences can be modified in place, for instance via the [set]
   and [blit] functions described below.  See also strings (module
   {!String}), which are almost the same data structure, but cannot be
   modified in place.

   Bytes are represented by the OCaml type [char].

   The labeled version of this module can be used as described in the
   {!StdLabels} module.

(** {1:unsafe Unsafe conversions (for advanced users)}

    This section describes unsafe, low-level conversion functions
    between [bytes] and [string]. They do not copy the internal data;
    used improperly, they can break the immutability invariant on
    strings provided by the [-safe-string] option. They are available for
    expert library authors, but for most purposes you should use the
    always-correct {!to_string} and {!of_string} instead.
*)

val unsafe_to_string : bytes -> string
(** Unsafely convert a byte sequence into a string.

    To reason about the use of [unsafe_to_string], it is convenient to
    consider an "ownership" discipline. A piece of code that
    manipulates some data "owns" it; there are several disjoint ownership
    modes, including:
    - Unique ownership: the data may be accessed and mutated
    - Shared ownership: the data has several owners, that may only
      access it, not mutate it.

    Unique ownership is linear: passing the data to another piece of
    code means giving up ownership (we cannot write the
    data again). A unique owner may decide to make the data shared
    (giving up mutation rights on it), but shared data may not become
    uniquely-owned again.

   [unsafe_to_string s] can only be used when the caller owns the byte
   sequence [s] -- either uniquely or as shared immutable data. The
   caller gives up ownership of [s], and gains ownership of the
   returned string.

   There are two valid use-cases that respect this ownership
   discipline:

   1. Creating a string by initializing and mutating a byte sequence
   that is never changed after initialization is performed.

   {[
let string_init len f : string =
  let s = Bytes.create len in
  for i = 0 to len - 1 do Bytes.set s i (f i) done;
  Bytes.unsafe_to_string s
   ]}

   This function is safe because the byte sequence [s] will never be
   accessed or mutated after [unsafe_to_string] is called. The
   [string_init] code gives up ownership of [s], and returns the
   ownership of the resulting string to its caller.

   Note that it would be unsafe if [s] was passed as an additional
   parameter to the function [f] as it could escape this way and be
   mutated in the future -- [string_init] would give up ownership of
   [s] to pass it to [f], and could not call [unsafe_to_string]
   safely.

   We have provided the {!String.init}, {!String.map} and
   {!String.mapi} functions to cover most cases of building
   new strings. You should prefer those over [to_string] or
   [unsafe_to_string] whenever applicable.

   2. Temporarily giving ownership of a byte sequence to a function
   that expects a uniquely owned string and returns ownership back, so
   that we can mutate the sequence again after the call ended.

   {[
let bytes_length (s : bytes) =
  String.length (Bytes.unsafe_to_string s)
   ]}

   In this use-case, we do not promise that [s] will never be mutated
   after the call to [bytes_length s]. The {!String.length} function
   temporarily borrows unique ownership of the byte sequence
   (and sees it as a [string]), but returns this ownership back to
   the caller, which may assume that [s] is still a valid byte
   sequence after the call. Note that this is only correct because we
   know that {!String.length} does not capture its argument -- it could
   escape by a side-channel such as a memoization combinator.

   The caller may not mutate [s] while the string is borrowed (it has
   temporarily given up ownership). This affects concurrent programs,
   but also higher-order functions: if {!String.length} returned
   a closure to be called later, [s] should not be mutated until this
   closure is fully applied and returns ownership.
*)

val unsafe_of_string : string -> bytes
(** Unsafely convert a shared string to a byte sequence that should
    not be mutated.

    The same ownership discipline that makes [unsafe_to_string]
    correct applies to [unsafe_of_string]: you may use it if you were
    the owner of the [string] value, and you will own the return
    [bytes] in the same mode.

    In practice, unique ownership of string values is extremely
    difficult to reason about correctly. You should always assume
    strings are shared, never uniquely owned.

    For example, string literals are implicitly shared by the
    compiler, so you never uniquely own them.

    {[
let incorrect = Bytes.unsafe_of_string "hello"
let s = Bytes.of_string "hello"
    ]}

    The first declaration is incorrect, because the string literal
    ["hello"] could be shared by the compiler with other parts of the
    program, and mutating [incorrect] is a bug. You must always use
    the second version, which performs a copy and is thus correct.

    Assuming unique ownership of strings that are not string
    literals, but are (partly) built from string literals, is also
    incorrect. For example, mutating [unsafe_of_string ("foo" ^ s)]
    could mutate the shared string ["foo"] -- assuming a rope-like
    representation of strings. More generally, functions operating on
    strings will assume shared ownership, they do not preserve unique
    ownership. It is thus incorrect to assume unique ownership of the
    result of [unsafe_of_string].

    The only case we have reasonable confidence is safe is if the
    produced [bytes] is shared -- used as an immutable byte
    sequence. This is possibly useful for incremental migration of
    low-level programs that manipulate immutable sequences of bytes
    (for example {!Marshal.from_bytes}) and previously used the
    [string] type for this purpose.
