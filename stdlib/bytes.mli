(** Byte sequence operations.

   A byte sequence is a mutable data structure that contains a
   fixed-length sequence of bytes. Each byte can be indexed in
   constant time for reading or writing.

   Given a byte sequence [s] of length [l], we can access each of the
   [l] bytes of [s] via its index in the sequence. Indexes start at
   [0], and we will call an index valid in [s] if it falls within the
   range [[0...l-1]] (inclusive). A position is the point between two
   bytes or at the beginning or end of the sequence.  We call a
   position valid in [s] if it falls within the range [[0...l]]
   (inclusive). Note that the byte at index [n] is between positions
   [n] and [n+1].

   Two parameters [start] and [len] are said to designate a valid
   range of [s] if [len >= 0] and [start] and [start+len] are valid
   positions in [s].

   Byte sequences can be modified in place, for instance via the [set]
   and [blit] functions described below.  See also strings (module
   {!String}), which are almost the same data structure, but cannot be
   modified in place.

   Bytes are represented by the OCaml type [char].

 *)

external length : bytes -> int = "%string_length"
(** Return the length (number of bytes) of the argument. *)

external get : bytes -> int -> char = "%string_safe_get"
(** [get s n] returns the byte at index [n] in argument [s].

    Raise [Invalid_argument] if [n] not a valid index in [s]. *)

external set : bytes -> int -> char -> unit = "%string_safe_set"
(** [set s n c] modifies [s] in place, replacing the byte at index [n]
    with [c].

    Raise [Invalid_argument] if [n] is not a valid index in [s]. *)

external create : int -> bytes = "caml_create_string"
(** [create n] returns a new byte sequence of length [n]. The
    sequence is uninitialized and contains arbitrary bytes.

    Raise [Invalid_argument] if [n < 0] or [n > ]{!Sys.max_string_length}. *)

val make : int -> char -> bytes
(** [make n c] returns a new byte sequence of length [n], filled with
    the byte [c].

    Raise [Invalid_argument] if [n < 0] or [n > ]{!Sys.max_string_length}. *)

val empty : bytes
(** A byte sequence of size 0. *)

val copy : bytes -> bytes
(** Return a new byte sequence that contains the same bytes as the
    argument. *)

val of_string : string -> bytes
(** Return a new byte sequence that contains the same bytes as the
    given string. *)

val to_string : bytes -> string
(** Return a new string that contains the same bytes as the given byte
    sequence. *)

val sub : bytes -> int -> int -> bytes
(** [sub s start len] returns a new byte sequence of length [len],
    containing the subsequence of [s] that starts at position [start]
    and has length [len].

    Raise [Invalid_argument] if [start] and [len] do not designate a
    valid range of [s]. *)

val sub_string : bytes -> int -> int -> string
(** Same as [sub] but return a string instead of a byte sequence. *)

val fill : bytes -> int -> int -> char -> unit
(** [fill s start len c] modifies [s] in place, replacing [len]
    characters with [c], starting at [start].

    Raise [Invalid_argument] if [start] and [len] do not designate a
    valid range of [s]. *)

val blit : bytes -> int -> bytes -> int -> int -> unit
(** [blit src srcoff dst dstoff len] copies [len] bytes from sequence
    [src], starting at index [srcoff], to sequence [dst], starting at
    index [dstoff]. It works correctly even if [src] and [dst] are the
    same byte sequence, and the source and destination intervals
    overlap.

    Raise [Invalid_argument] if [srcoff] and [len] do not
    designate a valid range of [src], or if [dstoff] and [len]
    do not designate a valid range of [dst]. *)

val concat : bytes -> bytes list -> bytes
(** [concat sep sl] concatenates the list of byte sequences [sl],
    inserting the separator byte sequence [sep] between each, and
    returns the result as a new byte sequence. *)

val iter : (char -> unit) -> bytes -> unit
(** [iter f s] applies function [f] in turn to all the bytes of [s].
    It is equivalent to [f (get s 0); f (get s 1); ...; f (get s
    (length s - 1)); ()]. *)

val iteri : (int -> char -> unit) -> bytes -> unit
(** Same as {!Bytes.iter}, but the function is applied to the index of
    the byte as first argument and the byte itself as second
    argument. *)

val map : (char -> char) -> bytes -> bytes
(** [map f s] applies function [f] in turn to all the bytes of [s] and
    stores the resulting bytes in a new sequence that is returned as
    the result. *)

val trim : bytes -> bytes
(** Return a copy of the argument, without leading and trailing
    whitespace. The bytes regarded as whitespace are the ASCII
    characters [' '], ['\012'], ['\n'], ['\r'], and ['\t']. *)

val escaped : bytes -> bytes
(** Return a copy of the argument, with special characters represented
    by escape sequences, following the lexical conventions of OCaml. *)

val index : bytes -> char -> int
(** [index s c] returns the index of the first occurrence of byte [c]
    in [s].

    Raise [Not_found] if [c] does not occur in [s]. *)

val rindex : bytes -> char -> int
(** [rindex s c] returns the index of the last occurrence of byte [c]
    in [s].

    Raise [Not_found] if [c] does not occur in [s]. *)

val index_from : bytes -> int -> char -> int
(** [index_from s i c] returns the index of the first occurrence of
    byte [c] in [s] after position [i].  [Bytes.index s c] is
    equivalent to [Bytes.index_from s 0 c].

    Raise [Invalid_argument] if [i] is not a valid position in [s].
    Raise [Not_found] if [c] does not occur in [s] after position [i]. *)

val rindex_from : bytes -> int -> char -> int
(** [rindex_from s i c] returns the index of the last occurrence of
    byte [c] in [s] before position [i+1].  [rindex s c] is equivalent
    to [rindex_from s (Bytes.length s - 1) c].

    Raise [Invalid_argument] if [i+1] is not a valid position in [s].
    Raise [Not_found] if [c] does not occur in [s] before position [i+1]. *)

val contains : bytes -> char -> bool
(** [contains s c] tests if byte [c] appears in [s]. *)

val contains_from : bytes -> int -> char -> bool
(** [contains_from s start c] tests if byte [c] appears in [s] after
    position [start].  [contains s c] is equivalent to [contains_from
    s 0 c].

    Raise [Invalid_argument] if [start] is not a valid position in [s]. *)

val rcontains_from : bytes -> int -> char -> bool
(** [rcontains_from s stop c] tests if byte [c] appears in [s] before
    position [stop+1].

    Raise [Invalid_argument] if [stop < 0] or [stop+1] is not a valid
    position in [s]. *)

val uppercase : bytes -> bytes
(** Return a copy of the argument, with all lowercase letters
    translated to uppercase, including accented letters of the ISO
    Latin-1 (8859-1) character set. *)

val lowercase : bytes -> bytes
(** Return a copy of the argument, with all uppercase letters
    translated to lowercase, including accented letters of the ISO
    Latin-1 (8859-1) character set. *)

val capitalize : bytes -> bytes
(** Return a copy of the argument, with the first byte set to
    uppercase. *)

val uncapitalize : bytes -> bytes
(** Return a copy of the argument, with the first byte set to
    lowercase. *)

type t = bytes
(** An alias for the type of byte sequences. *)

val compare: t -> t -> int
(** The comparison function for byte sequences, with the same
    specification as {!Pervasives.compare}.  Along with the type [t],
    this function [compare] allows the module [Bytes] to be passed as
    argument to the functors {!Set.Make} and {!Map.Make}. *)
