(** Sequences.

   A sequence of type ['a Seq.t] can be thought of as a {b delayed list},
   that is, a list whose elements are computed only when they are demanded
   by a consumer. This allows sequences to be produced and transformed
   lazily (one element at a time) rather than eagerly (all elements at
   once). This also allows constructing conceptually infinite sequences.

   The type ['a Seq.t] is defined as a synonym for [unit -> 'a Seq.node].
   This is a function type: therefore, it is opaque. The consumer can {b
   query} a sequence in order to request the next element (if there is
   one), but cannot otherwise inspect the sequence in any way.

   Because it is opaque, the type ['a Seq.t] does {i not} reveal whether
   a sequence is:
   - {b persistent},
     which means that the sequence can be used as many times as desired,
     producing the same elements every time,
     just like an immutable list; or
   - {b ephemeral},
     which means that the sequence is not persistent.
     Querying an ephemeral sequence might have an observable side effect,
     such as incrementing a mutable counter.
     As a common special case, an ephemeral sequence can be {b affine},
     which means that it must be queried at most once.

   It also does {i not} reveal whether the elements of the sequence are:

   - {b pre-computed and stored} in memory,
     which means that querying the sequence is cheap;
   - {b computed when first demanded and then stored} in memory,
     which means that querying the sequence once can be expensive,
     but querying the same sequence again is cheap; or
   - {b re-computed every time they are demanded},
     which may or may not be cheap.

   It is up to the programmer to keep these distinctions in mind
   so as to understand the time and space requirements of sequences.

   For the sake of simplicity, most of the documentation that follows
   is written under the implicit assumption that the sequences at hand
   are persistent.
   We normally do not point out {i when} or {i how many times}
   each function is invoked, because that would be too verbose.
   For instance, in the description of [map], we write:
   "if [xs] is the sequence [x0; x1; ...]
    then [map f xs] is the sequence [f x0; f x1; ...]".
   If we wished to be more explicit,
   we could point out that the transformation takes place on demand:
   that is, the elements of [map f xs] are computed only when they
   are demanded. In other words,
   the definition [let ys = map f xs] terminates immediately and
   does not invoke [f]. The function call [f x0] takes place only when the
   first element of [ys] is demanded, via the function call [ys()].
   Furthermore, calling [ys()] twice causes [f x0] to be called twice
   as well. If one wishes for [f] to be applied at most once to each
   element of [xs], even in scenarios where [ys] is queried more than once,
   then one should use [let ys = memoize (map f xs)].

   As a general rule, the functions that build sequences, such as [map],
   [filter], [scan], [take], etc., produce sequences whose elements are
   computed only on demand. The functions that eagerly consume sequences,
   such as [is_empty], [find], [length], [iter], [fold_left],
   etc., are the functions that force computation to take place.

   When possible, we recommend using sequences rather than dispensers
   (functions of type [unit -> 'a option] that produce elements upon
   demand). Whereas sequences can be persistent or ephemeral, dispensers
   are always ephemeral, and are typically more difficult to work with
   than sequences. Two conversion functions, {!to_dispenser} and
   {!of_dispenser}, are provided.

type 'a t = unit -> 'a node
(** A sequence [xs] of type ['a t] is a delayed list of elements of
    type ['a]. Such a sequence is queried by performing a function
    application [xs()]. This function application returns a node,
    allowing the caller to determine whether the sequence is empty
    or nonempty, and in the latter case, to obtain its head and tail. *)

and +'a node =
  | Nil
  | Cons of 'a * 'a t (**)
(** A node is either [Nil], which means that the sequence is empty,
    or [Cons (x, xs)], which means that [x] is the first element
    of the sequence and that [xs] is the remainder of the sequence. *)

(** {1 Consuming sequences} *)

(**

   The functions in this section consume their argument, a sequence, either
   partially or completely:
   - [is_empty] and [uncons] consume the sequence down to depth 1.
     That is, they demand the first argument of the sequence, if there is one.
   - [iter], [fold_left], [length], etc., consume the sequence all the way to
     its end. They terminate only if the sequence is finite.
   - [for_all], [exists], [find], etc. consume the sequence down to a certain
     depth, which is a priori unpredictable.

   Similarly, among the functions that consume two sequences,
   one can distinguish two groups:
   - [iter2] and [fold_left2] consume both sequences all the way
     to the end, provided the sequences have the same length.
   - [for_all2], [exists2], [equal], [compare] consume the sequences down
     to a certain depth, which is a priori unpredictable.

   The functions that consume two sequences can be applied to two sequences
   of distinct lengths: in that case, the excess elements in the longer
   sequence are ignored. (It may be the case that one excess element is
   demanded, even though this element is not used.)

   None of the functions in this section is lazy. These functions
   are consumers: they force some computation to take place. *)

val is_empty : 'a t -> bool
(** [is_empty xs] determines whether the sequence [xs] is empty.

    It is recommended that the sequence [xs] be persistent.
    Indeed, [is_empty xs] demands the head of the sequence [xs],
    so, if [xs] is ephemeral, it may be the case that [xs] cannot
    be used any more after this call has taken place.

    that is, a pair of the head and tail of the sequence [xs].

    This equivalence holds if [xs] is persistent.
    If [xs] is ephemeral, then [uncons] must be preferred
    over separate calls to [head] and [tail],

    Querying either of the sequences returned by [partition_map f xs]

    [partition p xs] is equivalent to
    [filter p xs, filter (fun x -> not (p x)) xs].

    Consuming both of the sequences returned by [partition p xs] causes
    [xs] to be consumed twice and causes the function [f] to be applied
    twice to each element of the list.
    Therefore, [f] should be pure and cheap.
    Furthermore, [xs] should be persistent and cheap.
    If that is not the case, use [partition p (memoize xs)].
