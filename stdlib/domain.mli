type 'a t
(** A domain of type ['a t] runs independently, eventually producing a
    result of type 'a, or an exception *)

val spawn : (unit -> 'a) -> 'a t
(** [spawn f] creates a new domain that runs in parallel with the
    current domain. *)

val join : 'a t -> 'a
(** [join d] blocks until domain [d] runs to completion.
    If [d] results in a value, then that is returned by [join d].
    If [d] raises an uncaught exception, then that is thrown by [join d].
    Domains may only be joined once: subsequent uses of [join d]
    raise Invalid_argument. *)

type id = private int
(** Domains have unique integer identifiers *)

val get_id : 'a t -> id
(** [get_id d] returns the identifier of the domain [d] *)

(** [self ()] is the identifier of the currently running domain *)

val at_first_spawn : (unit -> unit) -> unit
(** Register the given function to be called before the first domain is
    spawned.

    @raise Invalid_argument if the first domain has already been spawned. *)

val at_exit : (unit -> unit) -> unit
(** Register the given function to be called at when a domain exits. This
    function is also registered with {!Stdlib.at_exit}. If the registered
    function raises an exception, the exceptions are ignored. *)

(** Register the given function to be called when a domain starts. This
    function is called before the callback specified to [spawn f] is
    executed. *)

(** If busy-waiting, calling cpu_relax () between iterations
    will improve performance on some CPU architectures *)

val set_name : string -> unit
(** [set_name s] set the domain's thread name to [s]. [s] should not be longer
    than 15 characters. If [s] is longer than 15 characters,
    raise Invalid_argument. *)

    (** [new_key f] returns a new key bound to initialiser [f] for accessing
        domain-local variables.

        If [split_from_parent] is provided, spawning a domain will derive the
        child value (for this key) from the parent value.

        Note that the [split_from_parent] call is computed in the parent
        domain, and is always computed regardless of whether the child domain
        will use it. If the splitting function is expensive or requires
        client-side computation, consider using ['a Lazy.t key].

    val set : 'a key -> 'a -> unit
    (** [set k v] updates the calling domain's domain-local state to associate
        the key [k] with value [v]. It overwrites any previous values associated
        to [k], which cannot be restored later. *)
