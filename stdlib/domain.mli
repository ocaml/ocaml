type !'a t
(** A domain of type ['a t] runs independently, eventually producing a
    result of type 'a, or an exception *)

val spawn : (unit -> 'a) -> 'a t
(** [spawn f] creates a new domain that runs in parallel with the
    current domain. *)

val join : 'a t -> 'a
(** [join d] blocks until domain [d] runs to completion. If [d] results in a
    value, then that is returned by [join d]. If [d] raises an uncaught
    exception, then that is re-raised by [join d]. *)

type id = private int
(** Domains have unique integer identifiers *)

val get_id : 'a t -> id
(** [get_id d] returns the identifier of the domain [d] *)

val self : unit -> id
(** [self ()] is the identifier of the currently running domain *)

val before_first_spawn : (unit -> unit) -> unit
(** [before_first_spawn f] registers [f] to be called before the first domain
    is spawned by the program. The functions registered with
    [before_first_spawn] are called on the main (initial) domain. The functions
    registered with [before_first_spawn] are called in 'first in, first out'
    order: the oldest function added with [before_first_spawn] is called first.

    @raise Invalid_argument if the program has already spawned a domain. *)

val at_each_spawn : (unit -> unit) -> unit
(** [at_each_spawn f] registers [f] to be called on the newly spawned domains.
    The function [f] is executed before the callback [g] specified in [spawn g]
    is executed. The registered functions are called in 'first in, first out'
    order: the oldest function added with [at_each_spawn] is called first. *)

val at_exit : (unit -> unit) -> unit
(** [at_exit f] registers [f] to be called when the current domain exits. Note
    that [at_exit] callbacks are domain-local and only apply to the calling
    domain. The registered functions are called in 'last in, first out' order:
    the function most recently added with [at_exit] is called first.

    The [at_exit] function can be used in combination with [at_each_spawn] to
    clean up domain-local resources. Consider the following example:

    {[
let temp_file_key = Domain.DLS.new_key (fun _ ->
  snd (Filename.open_temp_file "" ""))

let _ = Domain.(at_each_spawn (fun _ ->
  at_exit (fun _ -> close_out (DLS.get temp_file_key))))
    ]}

    The snippet above uses domain-local state ({!Domain.DLS}) to create a
    temporary file for each domain. The [at_each_spawn] callback installs an
    [at_exit] callback on each domain which closes the temporary file when the
    domain terminates.
    *)

val cpu_relax : unit -> unit
(** If busy-waiting, calling cpu_relax () between iterations
    will improve performance on some CPU architectures *)

val is_main_domain : unit -> bool
(** [is_main_domain ()] returns true if called from the initial domain. *)

val recommended_domain_count : int
(** The recommended maximum number of domains to be spawned. *)

module DLS : sig
(** Domain-local Storage *)

    type 'a key
    (** Type of a DLS key *)

    val new_key : ?split_from_parent:('a -> 'a) -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a key
    (** [new_key f] returns a new key bound to initialiser [f] for accessing
        domain-local variables.

        If [split_from_parent] is provided, spawning a domain will derive the
        child value (for this key) from the parent value.

        Note that the [split_from_parent] call is computed in the parent
        domain, and is always computed regardless of whether the child domain
        will use it. If the splitting function is expensive or requires
        client-side computation, consider using ['a Lazy.t key].
    *)

    val get : 'a key -> 'a
    (** [get k] returns [v] if a value [v] is associated to the key [k] on
        the calling domain's domain-local state. Sets [k]'s value with its
        initialiser and returns it otherwise. *)

    val set : 'a key -> 'a -> unit
    (** [set k v] updates the calling domain's domain-local state to associate
        the key [k] with value [v]. It overwrites any previous values associated
        to [k], which cannot be restored later. *)
