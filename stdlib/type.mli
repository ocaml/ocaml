(** Type introspection.

(** {1:witness Type equality witness} *)

type (_, _) eq = Equal: ('a, 'a) eq
(** The purpose of [eq] is to represent type equalities that may not otherwise
    be known by the type checker (e.g. because they may depend on dynamic data).

    A value of type [(a, b) eq] represents the fact that types [a] and [b] are
    equal.

    If one has a value [eq : (a, b) eq] that proves types [a] and [b] are equal,
    one can use it to convert a value of type [a] to a value of type [b] by
    pattern matching on [Equal]:
    {[
      let cast (type a) (type b) (Equal : (a, b) Type.eq) (a : a) : b = a
    ]}

    At runtime, this function acts as the identity on [a].
