val finalise : ('a -> unit) -> 'a -> unit
(** [finalise f v] registers [f] as a finalisation function for [v].
   [v] must be heap-allocated.  [f] will be called with [v] as
   argument at some point between the first time [v] becomes unreachable
   (including through weak pointers) and the time [v] is collected by
   the GC. Several functions can
   be registered for the same value, or even several instances of the
   same function.  Each instance will be called once (or never,
   if the program terminates before [v] becomes unreachable).

   The GC will call the finalisation functions in the order of
   deallocation.  When several values become unreachable at the
   same time (i.e. during the same GC cycle), the finalisation
   functions will be called in the reverse order of the corresponding
   calls to [finalise].  If [finalise] is called in the same order
   as the values are allocated, that means each value is finalised
   before the values it depends upon.  Of course, this becomes
   false if additional dependencies are introduced by assignments.

   In the presence of multiple OCaml threads it should be assumed that
   any particular finaliser may be executed in any of the threads.

   Anything reachable from the closure of finalisation functions
   is considered reachable, so the following code will not work
   as expected:
   - [ let v = ... in Gc.finalise (fun _ -> ...v...) v ]

   Instead you should make sure that [v] is not in the closure of
   the finalisation function by writing:
   - [ let f = fun x -> ...  let v = ... in Gc.finalise f v ]


   The [f] function can use all features of OCaml, including
   assignments that make the value reachable again.  It can also
   loop forever (in this case, the other
   finalisation functions will not be called during the execution of f,
   unless it calls [finalise_release]).
   It can call [finalise] on [v] or other values to register other
   functions or even itself.  It can raise an exception; in this case
   the exception will interrupt whatever the program was doing when
   the function was called.


   [finalise] will raise [Invalid_argument] if [v] is not
   guaranteed to be heap-allocated.  Some examples of values that are not
   heap-allocated are integers, constant constructors, booleans,
   the empty array, the empty list, the unit value.  The exact list
   of what is heap-allocated or not is implementation-dependent.
   Some constant values can be heap-allocated but never deallocated
   during the lifetime of the program, for example a list of integer
   constants; this is also implementation-dependent.
   Note that values of types [float] are sometimes allocated and
   sometimes not, so finalising them is unsafe, and [finalise] will
   also raise [Invalid_argument] for them. Values of type ['a Lazy.t]
   (for any ['a]) are like [float] in this respect, except that the
   compiler sometimes optimizes them in a way that prevents [finalise]
   from detecting them. In this case, it will not raise
   [Invalid_argument], but you should still avoid calling [finalise]
   on lazy values.


   The results of calling {!String.make}, {!Bytes.make}, {!Bytes.create},
   {!Array.make}, and {!Stdlib.ref} are guaranteed to be
   heap-allocated and non-constant except when the length argument is [0].
*)

val finalise_last : (unit -> unit) -> 'a -> unit
(** same as {!finalise} except the value is not given as argument. So
    you can't use the given value for the computation of the
    finalisation function. The benefit is that the function is called
    after the value is unreachable for the last time instead of the
    first time. So contrary to {!finalise} the value will never be
    reachable again or used again. In particular every weak pointer
    and ephemeron that contained this value as key or data is unset
    before running the finalisation function. Moreover the finalisation
    functions attached with {!finalise} are always called before the
    finalisation functions attached with {!finalise_last}.
