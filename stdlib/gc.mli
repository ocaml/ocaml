external full_major : unit -> unit = "caml_gc_full_major"

external compact : unit -> unit = "caml_gc_compaction"
(** Perform a full major collection and compact the heap.  Note that heap
   compaction is a lengthy operation. *)

val print_stat : out_channel -> unit
(** Print the current values of the memory management counters (in
   human-readable form) into the channel argument. *)

val allocated_bytes : unit -> float
(** Return the total number of bytes allocated since the program was
   started.  It is returned as a [float] to avoid overflow problems
   with [int] on 32-bit machines. *)

val finalise : ('a -> unit) -> 'a -> unit
(** [finalise f v] registers [f] as a finalisation function for [v].
   [v] must be heap-allocated.  [f] will be called with [v] as
   argument at some point between the first time [v] becomes unreachable
   and the time [v] is collected by the GC.  Several functions can
   be registered for the same value, or even several instances of the
   same function.  Each instance will be called once (or never,
   if the program terminates before [v] becomes unreachable).

   The GC will call the finalisation functions in the order of
   deallocation.  When several values become unreachable at the
   same time (i.e. during the same GC cycle), the finalisation
   functions will be called in the reverse order of the corresponding
   calls to [finalise].  If [finalise] is called in the same order
   as the values are allocated, that means each value is finalised
   before the values it depends upon.  Of course, this becomes
   false if additional dependencies are introduced by assignments.

   In the presence of multiple OCaml threads it should be assumed that
   any particular finaliser may be executed in any of the threads.

   Anything reachable from the closure of finalisation functions
   is considered reachable, so the following code will not work
   as expected:
   - [ let v = ... in Gc.finalise (fun x -> ...) v ]

   Instead you should write:
   - [ let f = fun x -> ... ;; let v = ... in Gc.finalise f v ]


   The [f] function can use all features of OCaml, including
   assignments that make the value reachable again.  It can also
   loop forever (in this case, the other
   finalisation functions will not be called during the execution of f,
   unless it calls [finalise_release]).
   It can call [finalise] on [v] or other values to register other
   functions or even itself.  It can raise an exception; in this case
   the exception will interrupt whatever the program was doing when
   the function was called.


   [finalise] will raise [Invalid_argument] if [v] is not
   heap-allocated.  Some examples of values that are not
   heap-allocated are integers, constant constructors, booleans,
   the empty array, the empty list, the unit value.  The exact list
   of what is heap-allocated or not is implementation-dependent.
   Some constant values can be heap-allocated but never deallocated
   during the lifetime of the program, for example a list of integer
   constants; this is also implementation-dependent.
   You should also be aware that compiler optimisations may duplicate
   some immutable values, for example floating-point numbers when
   stored into arrays, so they can be finalised and collected while
   another copy is still in use by the program.


   The results of calling {!String.make}, {!Bytes.make}, {!Bytes.create},
   {!Array.make}, and {!Pervasives.ref} are guaranteed to be
   heap-allocated and non-constant except when the length argument is [0].

val finalise_release : unit -> unit;;

    GC that it can launch the next finalisation function without waiting
    for the current one to return. *)

   use to call [delete_alarm]. *)

val delete_alarm : alarm -> unit
(** [delete_alarm a] will stop the calls to the function associated
   to [a].  Calling [delete_alarm a] again has no effect. *)
