(** Facilities for printing exceptions. *)

val to_string : exn -> string
(** [Printexc.to_string e] returns a string representation of
   the exception [e]. *)

val print : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b
(** [Printexc.print fn x] applies [fn] to [x] and returns the result.
   If the evaluation of [fn x] raises any exception, the
   name of the exception is printed on standard error output,
   and the exception is raised again.
   The typical use is to catch and report exceptions that
   escape a function application. *)

val catch : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b
(** [Printexc.catch fn x] is similar to {!Printexc.print}, but
   aborts the program with exit code 2 after printing the
   uncaught exception.  This function is deprecated: the runtime
   system is now able to print uncaught exceptions as precisely
   as [Printexc.catch] does.  Moreover, calling [Printexc.catch]
   makes it harder to track the location of the exception
   using the debugger or the stack backtrace facility.
   So, do not use [Printexc.catch] in new code.  *)
