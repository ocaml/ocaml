(* {2 The type ['a t]}

   A dynamic array is represented using a backing array [arr] and
   a [length]. It behaves as an array of size [length] -- the indices
   from [0] to [length - 1] included contain user-provided values and
   can be [get] and [set] -- but the length may also change in the
   future by adding or removing elements at the end.

   We use the following concepts;
   - capacity: the length of the backing array:
     [Array.length  arr]
   - live space: the portion of the backing array with
     indices from [0] to [length - 1] included.
   - empty space: the portion of the backing array
     from [length] to the end of the backing array.

   {2 Dummies}

   We should not keep a user-provided value in the empty space, as
   this could extend its lifetime and may result in memory leaks of
   arbitrary size. Functions that remove elements from the dynamic
   array, such as [pop_last] or [truncate], must really erase the
   element from the backing array.

   To do so, we use an unsafe/magical [dummy] in the empty array. This
   dummy is *not* type-safe, it is not a valid value of type ['a], so
   we must be very careful never to return it to the user. After
   accessing any element of the array, we must check that it is not
   the dummy. In particular, this dummy must be distinct from any
   other value the user could provide -- we ensure this by using
   a dynamically-allocated mutable reference as our dummy.

   {2 Invariants and valid states}

   We enforce the invariant that [length >= 0] at all times.
   we rely on this invariant for optimization.

   The following conditions define what we call a "valid" dynarray:
   - valid length: [length <= Array.length arr]
   - no missing element in the live space:
     forall i, [0 <= i < length] implies [arr.(i) != dummy]
   - no element in the empty space:
     forall i, [length <= i < Array.length arr] implies [arr.(i) == dummy]

   Unfortunately, we cannot easily enforce validity as an invariant in
   presence of concurrent updates. We can thus observe dynarrays in
   "invalid states". Our implementation may raise exceptions or return
   incorrect results on observing invalid states, but of course it
   must preserve memory safety.

   {3 Dummies and flat float arrays}

   OCaml performs a dynamic optimization of the representation of
   float arrays, which is incompatible with our use of a dummy
   value: if we initialize an array with user-provided elements,
   it may get an optimized into a "flat float array", and
   writing our non-float dummy into it would crash.

   To avoid interactions between unsafe dummies and flat float arrays,
   we ensure that the arrays that we use are never initialized with
   floating point values. In that case we will always get a non-flat
   array, and storing float values inside those is safe
   (if less efficient). We call this the 'no-flat-float' invariant.

   {3 Marshalling dummies}

   There is a risk of interaction between dummies and
   marshalling. If we use a global dynamically-allocated dummy
   for the whole module, we are not robust to a user marshalling
   a dynarray and unmarshalling it inside another program with
   a different global dummy.

   The trick is to store the dummy that we use in the dynarray
   metadata record. Marshalling the dynarray will then preserve the
   physical equality between this dummy field and dummy elements in
   the array, as expected.

   This reasoning assumes that marshalling does not use the
   [No_sharing] flag. To ensure that users do not marshal dummies
   with [No_sharing], we use a recursive/cyclic dummy that would make
   such marshalling loop forever. (This is not nice, but better than
   segfaulting later for obscure reasons.)

(** The [Dummy] module encapsulates the low-level magic we use
    for dummies, providing a strongly-typed API that:
    - makes it explicit where dummies are used
    - makes it hard to mistakenly mix data using distinct dummies,
      which would be unsound *)

       behavior than "fill then notify" in presence of reentrant
       modifications (which may occur on [blit] below):

       - If some code asynchronously adds new elements after this
         length update, they will go after the space we just reserved,
         and in particular no addition will be lost. If instead we
         updated the length after the loop, any asynchronous addition
         during the loop could be erased or erase one of our additions,
         silently, without warning the user.

       - If some code asynchronously iterates on the dynarray, or
         removes elements, or otherwise tries to access the
         reserved-but-not-yet-filled space, it will get a clean "missing
         element" error. This is worse than with the fill-then-notify
         approach where the new elements would only become visible
         (to iterators, for removal, etc.) altogether at the end of
         loop.

       To summarise, "reserve before fill" is better on add-add races,
       and "fill then notify" is better on add-remove or add-iterate
       races. But the key difference is the failure mode:
       reserve-before fails on add-remove or add-iterate races with
       a clean error, while notify-after fails on add-add races with

(** {1:iteration Iteration} *)

(* The implementation choice that we made for iterators is the one
   that maximizes efficiency by avoiding repeated bound checking: we
   check the length of the dynamic array once at the beginning, and
   then only operate on that portion of the dynarray, ignoring
   elements added in the meantime.

   The specification states that it is a programming error to mutate
   the length of the array during iteration. We check for this and
   raise an error on size change.
   Note that we may still miss some transient state changes that cancel
   each other and leave the length unchanged at the next check.
*)

let iter_ fname f a =
  let Pack {arr; length; dummy} = a in
  (* [check_valid_length length arr] is used for memory safety, it
     guarantees that the backing array has capacity at least [length],
     allowing unsafe array access.

     [check_same_length] is used for correctness, it lets the function
     fail more often if we discover the programming error of mutating
     the length during iteration.

     We could, naively, call [check_same_length] at each iteration of
     the loop (before or after, or both). However, notice that this is
     not necessary to detect the removal of elements from [a]: if
     elements have been removed by the time the [for] loop reaches
     them, then [unsafe_get] will itself fail with an [Invalid_argument]
     exception. We only need to detect the addition of new elements to
     [a] during iteration, and for this it is enough to call
     [check_same_length] once at the end.

     Calling [check_same_length] more often could catch more
     programming errors, but the only errors that we miss with this
     optimization are those that keep the array size constant --
     additions and deletions that cancel each other. We consider this
     an acceptable tradeoff.
