type 'a t = {
  mutable length : int;
  mutable arr : 'a slot array;
}
(* {2 The type ['a t]}

   A dynamic array is represented using a backing array [arr] and
   a [length]. It behaves as an array of size [length] -- the indices
   from [0] to [length - 1] included contain user-provided values and
   can be [get] and [set] -- but the length may also change in the
   future by adding or removing elements at the end.

   We use the following concepts;
   - capacity: the length of the backing array:
     [Array.length  arr]
   - live space: the portion of the backing array with
     indices from [0] to [length - 1] included.
   - empty space: the portion of the backing array
     from [length] to the end of the backing array.

   {2 The type ['a slot]}

   We should not keep a user-provided value in the empty space, as
   this could extend its lifetime and may result in memory leaks of
   arbitrary size. Functions that remove elements from the dynamic
   array, such as [pop_last] or [truncate], must really erase the
   element from the backing array.

   This constraint makes it difficult to represent an dynamic array of
   elements of type ['a] with a backing array of type ['a array]: what
   valid value of type ['a] would we use in the empty space? Typical
   choices include:
   - accepting scenarios where we actually leak user-provided values
     (but this can blowup memory usage in some cases, and is hard to debug)
   - requiring a "dummy" value at creation of the dynamic array
     or in the parts of the API that grow the empty space
     (but users find this very inconvenient)
   - using arcane Obj.magic tricks
     (but experts don't agree on which tricks are safe to use and/or
      should be used here)
   - using a backing array of ['a option] values, using [None]
     in the empty space
     (but this gives a noticeably less efficient memory representation)

   In the present implementation, we use the ['a option] approach,
   with a twist. With ['a option], calling [set a i x] must reallocate
   a new [Some x] block:
{[
   let set a i x =
     if i < 0 || i >= a.length then error "out of bounds";
     a.arr.(i) <- Some x
]}
   Instead we use the type ['a slot] below,
   which behaves as an option whose [Some] constructor
   (called [Elem] here) has a _mutable_ argument.
*)
and 'a slot =
| Empty
| Elem of { mutable v: 'a }
(*
   This gives an allocation-free implementation of [set] that calls
   [Array.get] (instead of [Array.set]) on the backing array and then
   mutates the [v] parameter. In pseudo-code:
{[
   let set a i x =
     if i < 0 || i >= a.length then error "out of bounds";
     match a.arr.(i) with
     | Empty -> error "invalid state: missing element"
     | Elem s -> s.v <- x
]}
   With this approach, accessing an element still pays the cost of an
   extra indirection (compared to approaches that do not box elements
   in the backing array), but only operations that add new elements at
   the end of the array pay extra allocations.

   There are some situations where ['a option] is better: it makes
   [pop_last_opt] more efficient as the underlying option can be
   returned directly, and it also lets us use [Array.blit] to
   implement [append]. We believe that optimizing [get] and [set] is
   more important for dynamic arrays.

   {2 Invariants and valid states}

   We enforce the invariant that [length >= 0] at all times.
   we rely on this invariant for optimization.

   The following conditions define what we call a "valid" dynarray:
   - valid length: [length <= Array.length arr]
   - no missing element in the live space:
     forall i, [0 <= i < length] implies [arr.(i) <> Empty]
   - no element in the empty space:
     forall i, [length <= i < Array.length arr] implies [arr.(i) = Empty]

   Unfortunately, we cannot easily enforce validity as an invariant in
   presence of concurrent updates. We can thus observe dynarrays in
   "invalid states". Our implementation may raise exceptions or return
   incorrect results on observing invalid states, but of course it
   must preserve memory safety.

       the [Elem] allocation):

       - If some code asynchronously adds new elements after this
         length update, they will go after the space we just reserved,
         and in particular no addition will be lost. If instead we
         updated the length after the loop, any asynchronous addition
         during the loop could be erased or erase one of our additions,
         silently, without warning the user.

       - If some code asynchronously iterates on the dynarray, or
         removes elements, or otherwise tries to access the
         reserved-but-not-yet-filled space, it will get a clean "missing
         element" error. This is worse than with the fill-then-notify
         approach where the new elements would only become visible

       races. But the key difference is the failure mode:

     [check_same_length] is used for correctness, it lets the function
     fail more often if we discover the programming error of mutating
     the length during iteration.

     We could, naively, call [check_same_length] at each iteration of
     the loop (before or after, or both). However, notice that this is
     not necessary to detect the removal of elements from [a]: if

     Calling [check_same_length] more often could catch more
     programming errors, but the only errors that we miss with this

     additions and deletions that cancel each other. We consider this
