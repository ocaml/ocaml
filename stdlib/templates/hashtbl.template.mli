(** {1 Generic interface} *)


type (!'a, !'b) t
(** The type of hash tables from type ['a] to type ['b]. *)

val create : ?random: (* thwart tools/sync_stdlib_docs *) bool ->
             int -> ('a, 'b) t
(** [Hashtbl.create n] creates a new, empty hash table, with
   initial size [n].  For best results, [n] should be on the
   order of the expected number of elements that will be in
   the table.  The table grows as needed, so [n] is just an
   initial guess.

   The optional [~][random] parameter (a boolean) controls whether
   the internal organization of the hash table is randomized at each
   execution of [Hashtbl.create] or deterministic over all executions.

   A hash table that is created with [~][random] set to [false] uses a
   fixed hash function ({!hash}) to distribute keys among
   buckets.  As a consequence, collisions between keys happen
   deterministically.  In Web-facing applications or other
   security-sensitive applications, the deterministic collision
   patterns can be exploited by a malicious user to create a
   denial-of-service attack: the attacker sends input crafted to
   create many collisions in the table, slowing the application down.

   A hash table that is created with [~][random] set to [true] uses the seeded
   hash function {!seeded_hash} with a seed that is randomly chosen at hash
   table creation time.  In effect, the hash function used is randomly
   selected among [2^{30}] different hash functions.  All these hash
   functions have different collision patterns, rendering ineffective the
   denial-of-service attack described above.  However, because of
   randomization, enumerating all elements of the hash table using {!fold}
   or {!iter} is no longer deterministic: elements are enumerated in
   different orders at different runs of the program.

   If no [~][random] parameter is given, hash tables are created
   in non-random mode by default.  This default can be changed
   either programmatically by calling {!randomize} or by
   setting the [R] flag in the [OCAMLRUNPARAM] environment variable.

   @before 4.00.0 the [~][random] parameter was not present and all
   hash tables were created in non-randomized mode. *)

val clear : ('a, 'b) t -> unit

    size of the bucket table to its initial size. *)

    to its initial size.

val copy : ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'b) t
(** Return a copy of the given hashtable. *)

val add : ('a, 'b) t -> key:'a -> data:'b -> unit
(** [Hashtbl.add tbl ~key ~data] adds a binding of [key] to [data]
   in table [tbl].
   Previous bindings for [key] are not removed, but simply
   hidden. That is, after performing {!remove}[ tbl key],
   the previous binding for [key], if any, is restored.
   (Same behavior as with association lists.) *)

val find : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a -> 'b
(** [Hashtbl.find tbl x] returns the current binding of [x] in [tbl],
   or raises [Not_found] if no such binding exists. *)

val find_opt : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a -> 'b option

   bindings, in reverse order of introduction in the table. *)

val mem : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a -> bool
(** [Hashtbl.mem tbl x] checks if [x] is bound in [tbl]. *)

val remove : ('a, 'b) t -> 'a -> unit
(** [Hashtbl.remove tbl x] removes the current binding of [x] in [tbl],
   restoring the previous binding if it exists.
   It does nothing if [x] is not bound in [tbl]. *)

val replace : ('a, 'b) t -> key:'a -> data:'b -> unit
(** [Hashtbl.replace tbl ~key ~data] replaces the current binding of [key]
   in [tbl] by a binding of [key] to [data].  If [key] is unbound in [tbl],
   a binding of [key] to [data] is added to [tbl].
   This is functionally equivalent to {!remove}[ tbl key]
   followed by {!add}[ tbl key data]. *)

val iter : f:(key:'a -> data:'b -> unit) -> ('a, 'b) t -> unit
(** [Hashtbl.iter ~f tbl] applies [f] to all bindings in table [tbl].
   [f] receives the key as first argument, and the associated value
   as second argument. Each binding is presented exactly once to [f].

   The order in which the bindings are passed to [f] is unspecified.
   However, if the table contains several bindings for the same key,
   they are passed to [f] in reverse order of introduction, that is,
   the most recent binding is passed first.

   If the hash table was created in non-randomized mode, the order
   in which the bindings are enumerated is reproducible between
   successive runs of the program, and even between minor versions
   of OCaml.  For randomized hash tables, the order of enumeration
   is entirely random.

   The behavior is not defined if the hash table is modified
   by [f] during the iteration.

    [f].  If [f] returns [None], the binding is discarded.  If it
    returns [Some new_val], the binding is update to associate the key
    to [new_val].

    Other comments for {!iter} apply as well.

val fold : f:(key:'a -> data:'b -> 'c -> 'c) -> ('a, 'b) t -> init:'c -> 'c
(** [Hashtbl.fold ~f tbl ~init] computes

   where [k1 ... kN] are the keys of all bindings in [tbl],
   and [d1 ... dN] are the associated values.
   Each binding is presented exactly once to [f].

   The order in which the bindings are passed to [f] is unspecified.
   However, if the table contains several bindings for the same key,
   they are passed to [f] in reverse order of introduction, that is,

   is entirely random.

   by [f] during the iteration.
*)

val length : ('a, 'b) t -> int
(** [Hashtbl.length tbl] returns the number of bindings in [tbl].
   It takes constant time.  Multiple bindings are counted once each, so
   [Hashtbl.length] gives the number of times [Hashtbl.iter] calls its
   first argument. *)

val randomize : unit -> unit
(** After a call to [Hashtbl.randomize()], hash tables are created in
    randomized mode by default: {!create} returns randomized
    hash tables, unless the [~random:false] optional parameter is given.
    The same effect can be achieved by setting the [R] parameter in
    the [OCAMLRUNPARAM] environment variable.

    It is recommended that applications or Web frameworks that need to
    protect themselves against the denial-of-service attack described
    in {!create} call [Hashtbl.randomize()] at initialization
    time.

    Note that once [Hashtbl.randomize()] was called, there is no way
    to revert to the non-randomized default behavior of {!create}.
    This is intentional.  Non-randomized hash tables can still be
    created using [Hashtbl.create ~random:false].

    @since 4.00.0 *)

val rebuild : ?random (* thwart tools/sync_stdlib_docs *) :bool ->
    ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'b) t
(** Return a copy of the given hashtable.  Unlike {!copy},
    {!rebuild}[ h] re-hashes all the (key, value) entries of
    the original table [h].  The returned hash table is randomized if
    [h] was randomized, or the optional [random] parameter is true, or
    if the default is to create randomized hash tables; see
    {!create} for more information.

    {!rebuild} can safely be used to import a hash table built
    by an old version of the {!Hashtbl} module, then marshaled to
    persistent storage.  After unmarshaling, apply {!rebuild}
    to produce a hash table for the current version of the {!Hashtbl}

    @since 4.07 *)

(** {1 Functorial interface} *)

(** The functorial interface allows the use of specific comparison
    and hash functions, either for performance/security concerns,
    or because keys are not hashable/comparable with the polymorphic builtins.

    For instance, one might want to specialize a table for integer keys:
    {[
      module IntHash =
        struct
          type t = int
          let equal i j = i=j
          let hash i = i land max_int
        end

      module IntHashtbl = Hashtbl.Make(IntHash)

      let h = IntHashtbl.create 17 in
      IntHashtbl.add h 12 "hello"
    ]}

    This creates a new module [IntHashtbl], with a new type ['a
    IntHashtbl.t] of tables from [int] to ['a]. In this example, [h]
    contains [string] values so its type is [string IntHashtbl.t].

    Note that the new type ['a IntHashtbl.t] is not compatible with
    the type [('a,'b) Hashtbl.t] of the generic interface. For
    example, [Hashtbl.length h] would not type-check, you must use
    [IntHashtbl.length].
