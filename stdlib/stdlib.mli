   defined above,  with one difference on the treatment of the float value
   {!Pervasives.nan}.  Namely, the comparison predicates treat [nan]
   as different from any other float value, including itself;
   while [compare] treats [nan] as equal to itself and less than any
   other float value.  This treatment of [nan] ensures that [compare]
   defines a total ordering relation.

(** {1 Floating-point arithmetic}

   OCaml's floating-point numbers follow the
   IEEE 754 standard, using double precision (64 bits) numbers.
   Floating-point operations never raise an exception on overflow,
   underflow, division by zero, etc.  Instead, special IEEE numbers
   are returned as appropriate, such as [infinity] for [1.0 /. 0.0],
   [neg_infinity] for [-1.0 /. 0.0], and [nan] ('not a number')
   for [0.0 /. 0.0].  These special numbers then propagate through
   floating-point computations as expected: for instance,
   [1.0 /. infinity] is [0.0], and any arithmetic operation with [nan]
   as argument returns [nan] as result.

(** {1 Operations on format strings} *)

(** Format strings are character strings with special lexical conventions
  that defines the functionality of formatted input/output functions. Format
  strings are used to read data with formatted input functions from module
  {!Scanf} and to print data with formatted output functions from modules
  {!Printf} and {!Format}.

  Format strings are made of three kinds of entities:
  - {e conversions specifications}, introduced by the special character ['%']
    followed by one or more characters specifying what kind of argument to
    read or print,
  - {e formatting indications}, introduced by the special character ['@']
    followed by one or more characters specifying how to read or print the
    argument,
  - {e plain characters} that are regular characters with usual lexical
    conventions. Plain characters specify string literals to be read in the
    input or printed in the output.

  There is an additional lexical rule to escape the special characters ['%']
  and ['@'] in format strings: if a special character follows a ['%']
  character, it is treated as a plain character. In other words, ["%%"] is
  considered as a plain ['%'] and ["%@"] as a plain ['@'].

  For more information about conversion specifications and formatting
  indications available, read the documentation of modules {!Scanf},
  {!Printf} and {!Format}.
*)

(** Format strings have a general and highly polymorphic type
    [('a, 'b, 'c, 'd, 'e, 'f) format6].
    The two simplified types, [format] and [format4] below are
    included for backward compatibility with earlier releases of
    OCaml.

    The meaning of format string type parameters is as follows:

    - ['a] is the type of the parameters of the format for formatted output
      functions ([printf]-style functions);
      ['a] is the type of the values read by the format for formatted input
      functions ([scanf]-style functions).

    - ['b] is the type of input source for formatted input functions and the
      type of output target for formatted output functions.
      For [printf]-style functions from module {!Printf}, ['b] is typically
      [out_channel];
      for [printf]-style functions from module {!Format}, ['b] is typically
      {!Format.formatter};
      for [scanf]-style functions from module {!Scanf}, ['b] is typically
      {!Scanf.Scanning.in_channel}.

      Type argument ['b] is also the type of the first argument given to
      user's defined printing functions for [%a] and [%t] conversions,
      and user's defined reading functions for [%r] conversion.

    - ['c] is the type of the result of the [%a] and [%t] printing
      functions, and also the type of the argument transmitted to the
      first argument of [kprintf]-style functions or to the
      [kscanf]-style functions.

    - ['d] is the type of parameters for the [scanf]-style functions.

    - ['e] is the type of the receiver function for the [scanf]-style functions.

    - ['f] is the final result type of a formatted input/output function
      invocation: for the [printf]-style functions, it is typically [unit];
      for the [scanf]-style functions, it is typically the result type of the
      receiver function.
