(** Operations on file names. *)

val current_dir_name : string
(** The conventional name for the current directory (e.g. [.] in Unix). *)

val parent_dir_name : string
(** The conventional name for the parent of the current directory
   (e.g. [..] in Unix). *)

val dir_sep : string
(** The directory separator (e.g. [/] in Unix). @since 3.11.2 *)

val concat : string -> string -> string
(** [concat dir file] returns a file name that designates file
   [file] in directory [dir]. *)

val is_relative : string -> bool
(** Return [true] if the file name is relative to the current
   directory, [false] if it is absolute (i.e. in Unix, starts
   with [/]). *)

val is_implicit : string -> bool
(** Return [true] if the file name is relative and does not start
   with an explicit reference to the current directory ([./] or
   [../] in Unix), [false] if it starts with an explicit reference
   to the root directory or the current directory. *)

val check_suffix : string -> string -> bool
(** [check_suffix name suff] returns [true] if the filename [name]
   ends with the suffix [suff]. *)

val chop_suffix : string -> string -> string
(** [chop_suffix name suff] removes the suffix [suff] from
   the filename [name]. The behavior is undefined if [name] does not
   end with the suffix [suff]. *)

val chop_extension : string -> string
(** Return the given file name without its extension. The extension
   is the shortest suffix starting with a period and not including
   a directory separator, [.xyz] for instance.

   Raise [Invalid_argument] if the given name does not contain
   an extension. *)

val basename : string -> string
(** Split a file name into directory name / base file name.
   [concat (dirname name) (basename name)] returns a file name
   which is equivalent to [name]. Moreover, after setting the
   current directory to [dirname name] (with {!Sys.chdir}),
   references to [basename name] (which is a relative file name)
   designate the same file as [name] before the call to {!Sys.chdir}.

   The result is not specified if the argument is not a valid file name
   (for example, under Unix if there is a NUL character in the string). *)

val dirname : string -> string
(** See {!Filename.basename}. *)

val temp_file : ?temp_dir: string -> string -> string -> string
(** [temp_file prefix suffix] returns the name of a
   fresh temporary file in the temporary directory.
   The base name of the temporary file is formed by concatenating
   [prefix], then a suitably chosen integer number, then [suffix].
   The optional argument [temp_dir] indicates the temporary directory
   to use, defaulting to {!Filename.temp_dir_name}.
   The temporary file is created empty, with permissions [0o600]
   (readable and writable only by the file owner).  The file is
   guaranteed to be different from any other file that existed when
   [temp_file] was called.
   @before 3.11.2 no ?temp_dir optional argument
*)

val open_temp_file :
      ?mode: open_flag list -> ?temp_dir: string -> string -> string -> string * out_channel
(** Same as {!Filename.temp_file}, but returns both the name of a fresh
   temporary file, and an output channel opened (atomically) on
   this file.  This function is more secure than [temp_file]: there
   is no risk that the temporary file will be modified (e.g. replaced
   by a symbolic link) before the program opens it.  The optional argument
   [mode] is a list of additional flags to control the opening of the file.
   It can contain one or several of [Open_append], [Open_binary],
   and [Open_text].  The default is [[Open_text]] (open in text mode).
   @before 3.11.2 no ?temp_dir optional argument
*)

val temp_dir_name : string
(** The name of the temporary directory:
    Under Unix, the value of the [TMPDIR] environment variable, or "/tmp"
    if the variable is not set.
    Under Windows, the value of the [TEMP] environment variable, or "."
    if the variable is not set.
    @since 3.09.1
*)

val quote : string -> string
(** Return a quoted version of a file name, suitable for use as
    one argument in a command line, escaping all meta-characters.
    Warning: under Windows, the output is only suitable for use
    with programs that follow the standard Windows quoting
    conventions.
