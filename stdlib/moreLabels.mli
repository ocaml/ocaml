(** Extra labeled libraries.

   This meta-module provides labelized versions of the {!Hashtbl}, {!Map} and
   {!Set} modules.

   This module is intended to be used through [open MoreLabels] which replaces
   {!Hashtbl}, {!Map}, and {!Set} with their labeled counterparts.

   For example:
   {[
     open MoreLabels

     Hashtbl.iter ~f:(fun ~key ~data -> g key data) table
   ]}

module Hashtbl : sig
  (** Hash tables and hash functions.

     Hash tables are hashed association tables, with in-place modification.
     Because most operations on a hash table modify their input, they're
     more commonly used in imperative code. The lookup of the value associated
     with a key (see {!find}, {!find_opt}) is normally very fast, often faster
     than the equivalent lookup in {!Map}.

     The functors {!Make} and {!MakeSeeded} can be used when
     performance or flexibility are key.
     The user provides custom equality and hash functions for the key type,
     and obtains a custom hash table type for this particular type of key.

     {b Warning} a hash table is only as good as the hash function. A bad hash
     function will turn the table into a degenerate association list,
     with linear time lookup instead of constant time lookup.

     The polymorphic {!t} hash table is useful in simpler cases or
     in interactive environments. It uses the polymorphic {!hash} function
     defined in the OCaml runtime (at the time of writing, it's SipHash),
     as well as the polymorphic equality [(=)].

     See {{!examples} the examples section}.

  type (!'a, !'b) t = ('a, 'b) Hashtbl.t
  (** The type of hash tables from type ['a] to type ['b]. *)

  val create : ?random: (* thwart tools/sync_stdlib_docs *) bool ->
               int -> ('a, 'b) t
  (** [Hashtbl.create n] creates a new, empty hash table, with
     initial size [n].  For best results, [n] should be on the
     order of the expected number of elements that will be in
     the table.  The table grows as needed, so [n] is just an
     initial guess.

     The optional [~][random] parameter (a boolean) controls whether
     the internal organization of the hash table is randomized at each
     execution of [Hashtbl.create] or deterministic over all executions.

     A hash table that is created with [~][random] set to [false] uses a
     fixed hash function ({!hash}) to distribute keys among
     buckets.  As a consequence, collisions between keys happen
     deterministically.  In Web-facing applications or other
     security-sensitive applications, the deterministic collision
     patterns can be exploited by a malicious user to create a
     denial-of-service attack: the attacker sends input crafted to
     create many collisions in the table, slowing the application down.

     A hash table that is created with [~][random] set to [true] uses the seeded
     hash function {!seeded_hash} with a seed that is randomly chosen at hash
     table creation time.  In effect, the hash function used is randomly
     selected among [2^{30}] different hash functions.  All these hash
     functions have different collision patterns, rendering ineffective the
     denial-of-service attack described above.  However, because of
     randomization, enumerating all elements of the hash table using {!fold}
     or {!iter} is no longer deterministic: elements are enumerated in
     different orders at different runs of the program.

     If no [~][random] parameter is given, hash tables are created
     in non-random mode by default.  This default can be changed
     either programmatically by calling {!randomize} or by
     setting the [R] flag in the [OCAMLRUNPARAM] environment variable.

      It is recommended that applications or Web frameworks that need to

      in {!create} call [Hashtbl.randomize()] at initialization
      time before any domains are created.

      Note that once [Hashtbl.randomize()] was called, there is no way
      to revert to the non-randomized default behavior of {!create}.
      This is intentional.  Non-randomized hash tables can still be
      created using [Hashtbl.create ~random:false].

  (** {1 Functorial interface} *)

  (** The functorial interface allows the use of specific comparison
      and hash functions, either for performance/security concerns,
      or because keys are not hashable/comparable with the polymorphic builtins.

      For instance, one might want to specialize a table for integer keys:
      {[
        module IntHash =
          struct
            type t = int
            let equal i j = i=j
            let hash i = i land max_int
          end

        module IntHashtbl = Hashtbl.Make(IntHash)

        let h = IntHashtbl.create 17 in
        IntHashtbl.add h 12 "hello"
      ]}

      This creates a new module [IntHashtbl], with a new type ['a
      IntHashtbl.t] of tables from [int] to ['a]. In this example, [h]
      contains [string] values so its type is [string IntHashtbl.t].

      Note that the new type ['a IntHashtbl.t] is not compatible with
      the type [('a,'b) Hashtbl.t] of the generic interface. For
      example, [Hashtbl.length h] would not type-check, you must use
      [IntHashtbl.length].

  (** [Hashtbl.hash_param meaningful total x] computes a hash value for [x],
     with the same properties as for [hash]. The two extra integer
     parameters [meaningful] and [total] give more precise control over
     hashing. Hashing performs a breadth-first, left-to-right traversal
     of the structure [x], stopping after [meaningful] meaningful nodes
     were encountered, or [total] nodes (meaningful or not) were
     encountered.  If [total] as specified by the user exceeds a certain
     value, currently 256, then it is capped to that value.
     Meaningful nodes are: integers; floating-point
     numbers; strings; characters; booleans; and constant
     constructors. Larger values of [meaningful] and [total] means that
     more nodes are taken into account to compute the final hash value,
     and therefore collisions are less likely to happen.  However,
     hashing takes longer. The parameters [meaningful] and [total]
     govern the tradeoff between accuracy and speed.  As default
     choices, {!hash} and {!seeded_hash} take
     [meaningful = 10] and [total = 100]. *)

    {2 Counting Elements}

    Given a sequence of elements (here, a {!Seq.t}), we want to count how many
    times each distinct element occurs in the sequence. A simple way to do this,
    assuming the elements are comparable and hashable, is to use a hash table
    that maps elements to their number of occurrences.

    Here we illustrate that principle using a sequence of (ascii) characters
    (type [char]).
    We use a custom [Char_tbl] specialized for [char].

    {[
      # module Char_tbl = Hashtbl.Make(struct
          type t = char
          let equal = Char.equal
          let hash = Hashtbl.hash

module Map : sig
  (** Association tables over ordered types.

     This module implements applicative association tables, also known as
     finite maps or dictionaries, given a total ordering function
     over the keys.
     All operations over maps are purely applicative (no side-effects).
     The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and therefore searching
     and insertion take time logarithmic in the size of the map.

     For instance:
     {[
       module IntPairs =
         struct
           type t = int * int
           let compare (x0,y0) (x1,y1) =
             match Stdlib.compare x0 x1 with
                 0 -> Stdlib.compare y0 y1
               | c -> c
         end

       module PairsMap = Map.Make(IntPairs)

       let m = PairsMap.(empty |> add (0,1) "hello" |> add (1,0) "world")
     ]}

     This creates a new module [PairsMap], with a new type ['a PairsMap.t]
     of maps from [int * int] to ['a]. In this example, [m] contains [string]
     values so its type is [string PairsMap.t].

  (** Sets over ordered types.

     This module implements the set data structure, given a total ordering
     function over the set elements. All operations over sets
     are purely applicative (no side-effects).
     The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and is therefore
     reasonably efficient: insertion and membership take time
     logarithmic in the size of the set, for instance.

     The {!Make} functor constructs implementations for any type, given a
     [compare] function.
     For instance:
     {[
       module IntPairs =
         struct
           type t = int * int
           let compare (x0,y0) (x1,y1) =

       let m = PairsSet.(empty |> add (2,3) |> add (5,7) |> add (11,13))
