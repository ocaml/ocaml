(** Strings.

    A string [s] of length [n] is an indexable and immutable sequence
    of [n] bytes. For historical reasons these bytes are referred to
    as characters.

    The semantics of string functions is defined in terms of
    indices and positions. These are depicted and described
    as follows.

{v
positions  0   1   2   3   4    n-1    n
           +---+---+---+---+     +-----+
  indices  | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ... | n-1 |
           +---+---+---+---+     +-----+
v}
    {ul
    {- An {e index} [i] of [s] is an integer in the range \[[0];[n-1]\].
       It represents the [i]th byte (character) of [s] which can be
       accessed using the constant time string indexing operator
       [s.[i]].}
    {- A {e position} [i] of [s] is an integer in the range
       \[[0];[n]\]. It represents either the point at the beginning of
       the string, or the point between two indices, or the point at
       the end of the string. The [i]th byte index is between position
       [i] and [i+1].}}

    Two integers [start] and [len] are said to define a {e valid
    substring} of [s] if [len >= 0] and [start], [start+len] are
    positions of [s].

    {b Unicode text.} Strings being arbitrary sequences of bytes, they
    can hold any kind of textual encoding. However the recommended
    encoding for storing Unicode text in OCaml strings is UTF-8. This
    is the encoding used by Unicode escapes in string literals. For
    example the string ["\u{1F42B}"] is the UTF-8 encoding of the
    Unicode character U+1F42B.

    {b Past mutability.} OCaml strings used to be modifiable in place,
    for instance via the {!String.set} and {!String.blit}
    functions. This use is nowadays only possible when the compiler is
    put in "unsafe-string" mode by giving the [-unsafe-string]
    command-line option. This compatibility mode makes the types
    [string] and [bytes] (see {!Bytes.t}) interchangeable so that
    functions expecting byte sequences can also accept strings as
    arguments and modify them.

    The distinction between [bytes] and [string] was introduced in
    OCaml 4.02, and the "unsafe-string" compatibility mode was the
    default until OCaml 4.05. Starting with 4.06, the compatibility
    mode is opt-in; we intend to remove the option in the future.

    The labeled version of this module can be used as described in the
    {!StdLabels} module.
