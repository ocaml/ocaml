(** List operations.

   Some functions are flagged as not tail-recursive.  A tail-recursive
   function uses constant stack space, while a non-tail-recursive function
   uses stack space proportional to the length of its list argument, which
   can be a problem with very long lists.  When the function takes several
   list arguments, an approximate formula giving stack usage (in some
   unspecified constant unit) is shown in parentheses.

   The above considerations can usually be ignored if your lists are not
   longer than about 10000 elements.

   The labeled version of this module can be used as described in the
   {!StdLabels} module.
