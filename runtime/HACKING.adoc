= Tips on hacking the OCaml runtime system =

== Linking a test program with the debug runtime ==

Suppose you have a self-contained OCaml program `test.ml` that
crashes, you are working on a development repository (not an installed
version of your system). You probably want to run `test.ml` against
the "debug runtime", which in particular activates the `CAMLassert`
debug assertions.

If you want to use the bytecode compiler:

----
# build the runtime
make runtime -j

# compile as usual
./ocamlc.opt -nostdlib -I stdlib test.ml -o test

# run with the debug runtime (ocamlrund)
./runtime/ocamlrund ./test
----

If you want to use the native compiler:

----
# build the native runtime
make runtimeopt -j

# compile with "-runtime-variant d"
./ocamlopt.opt -nostdlib -I stdlib -runtime-variant d -I runtime test.ml -o test

./test
----

Note that the debug runtime does extra work, so it may slow down your
program -- and sometimes make the issue you are trying to debug
vanish.

== GC messages ==

The GC can send various messages about what it is doing, enabled with
the "v" option of OCAMLRUNPARAM. Various options are more or less
documented in
link:https://ocaml.org/manual/runtime.html#s:ocamlrun-options[].
You can enable all printing with

----
OCAMLRUNPARAM="v=0xffffffff" ./test
----

Note: `caml_gc_log` can be used to show log messages prefixed with the
thread number, and it corresponds to the more precise setting
`v=0x800`.

== Heap verification ==

Another useful OCAMLRUNPARAM setting is `V=1`, which enables
additional sanity checks on the heap during major GC cycles.

----
OCAMLRUNPARAM="V=1" ./test
----

== Getting stack traces after assertion failures (Linux) ==

The output of a crashing OCaml program may end up like this:

----
[03] file domain.c; line 404 ### Assertion failed: domain_state->young_start == NULL
Aborted (core dumped)
----

The message "core dumped" indicates that some debugging information was kept on the disk.

On Linux, systemd-enabled systems tend to use a systemd tool (of course!) to store core dumps.

----
# ask your system how core dumps are handled.
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
|/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-coredump %P %u %g %s %t %c %h
----

If your system is also using `systemd-coredump`, then the command
`coredumpctl dump` will show you information about the last "core
dump".

----
$ $ coredumpctl dump

== Using `rr` for deterministic replay debugging ==

There is a lot of information on how to use `rr` to debug the OCaml
runtime on the OCaml Multicore wiki:
link:https://github.com/ocaml-multicore/ocaml-multicore/wiki/Debugging-the-OCaml-Multicore-runtime#rr[].

TODO: it would be nice to migrate some information here.

== Compiling with sanitizers ==

TODO: I would be curious to know!

(For the brave there are some scripts in
link:../tools/ci/inria/sanitizers/script[], but you probably don't
want to run them directly, in particular they will `git clean -xfd`,
destroying changed/uncommited files in your development repository!)
