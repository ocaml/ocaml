/* Note [MM]: Enforcing the memory model.

   Multicore OCaml implements the memory consistency model defined in

     Bounding Data Races in Space and Time (PLDI '18)
     Stephen Dolan, KC Sivaramakrishnan, Anil Madhavapeddy.

   Unlike the C++ (also used in C11) memory model, this model gives
   well-defined behaviour to data races, ensuring that they do not
   affect unrelated computations. In C++, plain (non-atomic) accesses
   have undefined semantics if they race, so it is necessary to use at
   least relaxed atomics to implement all accesses.

   However, simply using C++ relaxed atomics for non-atomic accesses
   and C++ SC atomics for atomic ones is not enough, since the OCaml
   memory model is stronger. The prototypical example where C++
   exhibits a behaviour not allowed by OCaml is below. Assume that the
   reference b and the atomic reference a are initially 0:

       Thread 1            Thread 2
       Atomic.set a 1;     let x = !b in
       b := 1              let y = Atomic.get a in
                           ...
       Outcome: x = 1, y = 0

   This outcome is not permitted by the OCaml memory model, as can be
   seen from the operational model: if !b sees the write b := 1, then
   the Atomic.set must have executed before the Atomic.get, and since
   it is atomic the most recent set must be returned by the get,
   yielding y = 1. In the equivalent axiomatic model, this would be a
   violation of Causality.

   If this example is naively translated to C++ (using atomic_{load,
   store} for atomics, and atomic_{load, store}_explicit(...,
   memory_order_relaxed) for nonatomics), then this outcome becomes
   possible. The C++ model specifies that there is a total order on SC
   accesses, but this total order is surprisingly weak. In this
   example, we can have:

       x = !b ...
          [happens-before]
       y = Atomic.get a
          [SC-before]
       Atomic.set a 1
          [happens-before]
       b := 1

   Sadly, the composition of happens-before and SC-before does not add
   up to anything useful, and the C++ model permits the read 'x = !b'
   to read from the write 'b := 1' in this example, allowing the
   outcome above.

   To remedy this, we need to strengthen the relaxed accesses used for
   non-atomic loads and stores. The most straightforward way to do
   this is to use acquire loads and release stores instead of relaxed
   for non-atomic accesses, which ensures that all reads-from edges
   appear in the C++ synchronises-with relation, outlawing the outcome
   above.

   Using release stores for all writes also ensures publication safety
   for newly-allocated objects, and isn't necessary for initialising
   writes. The cost is free on x86, but requires a fence in
   caml_modify on weakly-ordered architectures (ARM, Power).

   However, instead of using acquire loads for all reads, an
   optimisation is possible. (Optimising reads is more important than
   optimising writes because reads are vastly more common). The OCaml
   memory model does not require ordering between non-atomic reads,
   which acquire loads provide. The acquire semantics are only
   necessary between a non-atomic read and an atomic access or a
   write, so we delay the acquire fence until one of those operations
   occurs.

   So, our non-atomic reads are implemented as standard relaxed loads,
   but non-atomic writes and atomic operations (in this file, below)
   contain an odd-looking line:

      atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_acquire)

   which serves to upgrade previous relaxed loads to acquire loads.
   This encodes the OCaml memory model in the primitives provided by
   the C++ model.

   On x86, all loads and all stores have acquire/release semantics by
   default anyway, so all of these fences compile away to nothing
   (They're still useful, though: they serve to inhibit an overeager C
   compiler's optimisations). On ARMv8, actual hardware fences are
   generated.

/* Note [MMMOC]: Mixing the Memory Models of OCaml and C.

   Note [MM] above document how the code generated by the OCaml
   compiler, and the memory-access helper functions it uses like
   [caml_modify], coordinate to provide a convenient memory model to
   pure OCaml programs.

   On the other hand, hybrid OCaml/C programs are written in two
   languages with two different memory models, and we currently do not
   know how to reason formally about the result. This affects C code
   that is written using the OCaml FFI, typically in user libraries,
   but also the C code of the OCaml runtime itself.

   The current recommendations for the runtime code are as follows:

   - For runtime data structures that are only used from C code, we
     should use C11 atomics.

   - But for the OCaml heap and any other data that is accessed both
     from the C runtime and from the OCaml mutator, we currently use
     (volatile *) following the Linux model
     (https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p0124r7.html):

       1. Using C11 atomics does not provide any correctness
          guarantees in presence of races coming from OCaml accesses, we
          need to reason on the assembly level anyway.

       2. Using consume or acquire or sequential may be too expensive
          (for a general use in the [Field] macro).

       3. Using relaxed and [volatile *] may be too weak in general,
          as our C code assumes a dependency ordering (reading fields
          after seeing a constructor).

       4. But in practice many usage patterns of [volatile *]
          (and possibly [relaxed]) are safe with C compilers. The
          dangerous patterns are unlikely to be met in real-life OCaml
          FFI code. We currently use a [volatile *] cast in Field
          for this reason.

   Note that these recommendations do not constitute a proper memory
   model for mixed OCaml/C programs. To be used safely, they should
   come with a set of guidelines on C programming patterns to avoid
   (and compilers, optimizers, compiler options to avoid...), similar
   to the Linux document
   https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/RCU/rcu_dereference.txt on
   RCU dereference. We do not currently have such a document.
