/* Overview of the stack switching primitives for effects
 *
 * For an understanding of effect handlers in OCaml please see:
 *  Retrofitting Effect Handlers onto OCaml, KC Sivaramakrishnan, et al.
 *  PLDI 2021
 *
 *  Native code
 *  -----------
 *
 * In native compilation the stack switching primitives Prunstack,
 * Pperform, Preperform and Presume make use of corresponding functions
 * implemented in the assembly files for an architecture (such as
 * runtime/amd64.S).
 *
 * A continuation object represents a suspended OCaml stack. It contains
 * the stack pointer tagged as an integer to avoid being followed by the GC.
 * In the code the tagged pointer can be referred to as a 'fiber':
 *     fiber := Val_ptr(stack)
 *
 * caml_runstack new_stack function argument
 *  caml_runstack launches a function (with an argument) in a new OCaml
 *  stack. It switches execution from the parent OCaml stack to the fresh
 *  stack and installs an exception handler. On return the new OCaml stack
 *  is freed, the stack is restored to the parent OCaml stack and the
 *  handle_value/handle_exn function is executed on the parent OCaml stack.
 *
 * caml_perform effect continuation
 *  caml_perform captures the current OCaml stack in the continuation object
 *  provided and raises the effect by switching to the parent OCaml stack and
 *  then executing the handle_effect function. Should there be no parent OCaml
 *  stack then the Unhandled exception is raised.
 *
 * caml_reperform effect continuation last_fiber
 *  caml_reperform is used to walk up the parent OCaml stacks to execute the
 *  next effect handler installed in the chain. This function is implemented
 *  by setting up the required registers then jumping into caml_perform which
 *  does the switch to the parent and execution of the handle_effect function.
 *
 * caml_resume new_fiber function argument
 *  caml_resume resumes execution on new_fiber by making the current stack
 *  the parent of the new_fiber and then switching to the stack for new_fiber.
 *  The function with argument is then executed on the new stack. Care is taken
 *  to check if the new_fiber argument has already been resumed and so is null.
 *
 *
 *  Bytecode
 *  --------
 *
 * In bytecode compilation the primitives are mapped to effect instructions and
 * some changes are made to the bytecode interpreter on every function return
 * and exception raise. In particular:
 *
 *  Presume | Prunstack -> RESUME (& RESUMETERM if a tail call)
 *   RESUME checks that the stack is valid (a NULL stack indicates a
 *   continuation that has already been resumed). The stacks are then switched
 *   with the old stack becoming the parent of the new stack. Care is taken
 *   to setup the exception handler for the new stack. Execution continues
 *   on the new OCaml stack with the passed function and argument.
 *
 *  Pperform -> PERFORM
 *   PERFORM captures the current stack in a continuation object it allocates.
 *   The parent stack is then switched to and the handle_effect function for
 *   the parent stack is executed. If no parent stack exists then the
 *   Unhandled exception is raised.
 *
 *  Preperform -> REPERFORMTERM
 *   REPERFORMTERM is used to walk up the parent OCaml stacks to execute the
 *   next effect handler installed in the chain. The instruction takes care to
 *   switch back to the continuation stack to raise the Unhandled exception in
 *   in the case no parent is left. Otherwise the instruction switches to the
 *   parent stack and executes the handle_effect function for that parent stack.
 *
 *  Special return handling:
 *   There is special handling on every function return (see do_return of
 *   interp.c). This handling allows the completion of a child stack to be
 *   detected. On completion of a child stack, the child stack is freed and
 *   control returns to the parent stack to execute the handle_value function.
 *
 *  Special exception handling:
 *   When an exception is raised (see raise_notrace of interp.c), the trap
 *   offset is checked. If there are no more exceptions in this stack and a
 *   parent stack exists, then the child stack is freed and the
 *   handle_exception function is executed on the parent stack.
