/* Classification of addresses for GC and runtime purposes. */

/* Multicore runtime supports only the "no naked pointers" mode where any
   out-of-heap pointers are not observable by the GC. The out-of-heap pointers
   are either:

   - wrapped in Abstract_tag or Custom_tag objects, or
   - have a valid header with colour `NOT_MARKABLE`, or
   - made to look like immediate values by tagging the least significant bit so
     that the GC does not follow it. This strategy has the downside that
     out-of-heap pointers may not point to odd addresses.

   A valid value is either:
   - a tagged integer (Is_long)
   - a pointer to the minor heap
   - a pointer to a well-formed block outside the minor heap. It may be in the
     major heap, or static data allocated by the OCaml code or the OCaml
     runtime, or a foreign pointer.

   To create a well-formed block outside the heap that the GC will not scan,
   one can use the Caml_out_of_heap_header from mlvalues.h.
