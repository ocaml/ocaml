#define CAML_INTERNALS

/* A concurrent dictionary data structure implemented as skip lists. This
    implementation is based on the sequential skip list implemetation in
    the runtime by Xavier Leroy but extends it to be safe under concurrent
    modification. It has the property that insert/remove are lock-free and
    contains is further wait-free. It is literally a textbook implementation
    and can be found in Herlihy et al's "The Art of Multiprocessor
    Programming" 2nd Edition, section 14.4. It only differs from the
    textbook implementation to fix errors in the pseudocode in [contains],
    to add a [search_level] optimisation to the data structure, replacing Java's
    volatile with atomics and to keep a list of removed nodes in order to do a
    deferred free.

    You _must_ call [caml_lf_skiplist_free_garbage] "every so often" in order
    for the data structure to free removed nodes. This must be done by only
    one thread at a time when no other thread can be accessing the structure.

    It is roughly half the speed of the sequential skip list so only use
    where concurrent access is necessary. For use-cases where there is
    only infrequent contention and where acquiring a lock during find is
    allowed then a sequential skip list guarded by a mutex may perform
    better.

    A sequential implementation of skip lists is in file skiplist.c and is based
    on the paper by William Pugh, "Skip lists: a probabilistic alternative to
    balanced binary trees", Comm. ACM 33(6), 1990). */
