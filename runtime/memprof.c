/* Design
 *
 * 1. Data Design
 *
 * 1.1. Configuration
 *
 * A Gc.Memprof.t value (a "profile" from the OCaml point of view) is
 * a block on the OCaml heap containing the profile configuration. As
 * a profile may be shared between threads and domains, keeping it on
 * the OCaml heap allows us not to worry about its liveness - pointers
 * to it from memprof data structures are simply treated as GC roots.
 * The "status" field in this object allows distinct domains to safely
 * `stop` and `discard` (with atomic reads and writes).
 *
 * 1.2. Entries
 *
 * Each block of memory tracked by memprof is represented by an
 * "entry" structure (entry_s, *entry_t). It tracks the state of the
 * block of memory, and its progress through the various callbacks.
 *
 * A resizable table of entry structures is called an "entries" table
 * (entries_s, *entries_t). It tracks ranges of those entries which
 * may (a) be ripe for running a callback, (b) be marked for deletion,
 * or (c) contain pointers to the minor heap (to be scanned in a minor
 * collection). As processing each of these actions proceeds linearly
 * through the table, this tracking is done simply by keeping the
 * lowest possible entry index for each purpose. The code to perform
 * each action (running a callback, evicting a deleted entry, or
 * scanning a pointer) checks whether an entry does require the action
 * before performing it.
 *
 * The entries table also has a pointer to the configuration object on
 * the OCaml heap, for the profile under which all the entries in the
 * table were sampled. This allows callbacks on the table to be run at
 * any later time, regardless of the currently-sampling profile of the
 * particular domain running the callback. A consequence is that all
 * entries in a table must be from the same profile.
 *
 * After a profile is "discarded", entries may still exist for blocks
 * allocated in that profile, but no callbacks will be called for it
 * (those entries themselves will be discarded lazily).
 *
 * There is code for iterating over entries in a table, which is used
 * when scanning for GC roots or updating tables to reflect GC activity
 * (see below).
 *
 * 1.3. Threads
 *
 * The memprof state of a particular systhread is a "thread state"
 * (memprof_thread_s, *memprof_thread_t). It has an entries table, for
 * blocks allocated by this thread whose allocation callback has not
 * yet completed. All allocation callbacks are guaranteed to be called
 * by the thread performing the allocation (in the rare circumstance in
 * which this is impossible, the tracking entry is discarded).
 *
 * This thread state structure exists whether or not the systhreads
 * module is initialized (one thread state per domain), and whether or
 * not memprof is running.
 *
 * 1.4. Domains
 *
 * The memprof state of a domain is a "domain state"
 * (memprof_domain_s, *memprof_domain_t). It has an entries table, for
 * blocks allocated in this domain whose allocation callbacks have
 * completed. If a domain terminates, or starts a new profile, while
 * it still has tracked entries from a previous profile, those tracked
 * entries become "orphaned" (see below).
 *
 * The domain state has a linked list of thread states for all the
 * threads in the domain, and a pointer to the current thread state.
 *
 * This structure exists whether or not memprof is running. A pointer
 * to it is kept in the caml_domain_state.
 *
 * 1.5. Orphans
 *
 * When sampling is stopped for a profile, all domains and threads
 * continue to manage the entry tables for it as before, but without
 * sampling and creating new entries. However, if a domain _starts_ a
 * profile while it has entries (tracked blocks) from a previous
 * profile which has not been "discarded", it moves those entries to
 * its "orphans" list - a linked list of entry tables - for subsequent
 * processing.
 *
 * If a domain is terminated, all its current and orphaned entries
 * (and those of its threads) are moved to a global `orphans`
 * list. This list, and its protective lock `orphans_lock`, are the
 * only memprof global variables. No domain processes the entries in
 * the global orphans list directly: the first domain to look at the
 * list (either at a collection or when checking for pending
 * callbacks) adopts all entry tables on it into its own orphans list,
 * and then processes them as its own.
 *
 * 2. Synchronisation
 *
 * Mostly threads and domains are free to run callbacks on their own
 * allocated blocks without explicitly synchronising. Care is taken
 * not to assume that the memprof state of any given thread or entry
 * in a domain is preserved outside of memprof code, as another thread
 * in the same domain may run and modify that state, but we assume
 * that the systhreads module effectively serializes entries to
 * memprof within a single domain (for these purposes, entering and
 * returning from a callback is treated as leaving and re-entering
 * memprof code).
 *
 * However, there are some structures shared between domains. The main
 * such structure is the profile configuration object on the Caml
 * heap. The only field written in this object is the status field,
 * used to communicate between domains sharing the profile, when a
 * profile is stopped or discarded. This field is inspected or set
 * atomically by the `Status` and `Set_status` macros. If a profile is
 * found to be discarded (`CONFIG_STATUS_DISCARDED`) then no domain
 * need take any action on it (and we can lazily discard any state
 * from it).
 *
 * The only other data shared between domains is the global orphans
 * list. As noted above, this is protected by a single global lock,
 * `orphans_lock`. Because an entry table only gets onto the global
 * orphans list when its owning domain terminates (at which point all
 * threads of that domain have terminated), and a table is adopted
 * from the global orphans list before being processed, all callbacks
 * and other entry table processing is performed by a thread of the
 * domain which owns the entry table. (and actions of those threads
 * are serialized by `systhreads`).
 *
 * 3. Interface with GC
 *
 * 3.1. Root scanning
 *
 * Memprof may have a large number of strong GC roots: one per tracked
 * block, pointing to the tracking information ('minor or 'major, in
 * the Gc.Memprof.tracker sense), plus the pointer to a config block
 * in every entries table. Rather than manually registering and
 * deregistering all of these, the GC calls caml_memprof_scan_roots()
 * to scan them, in either minor or major collections. This function
 * is called by all domains in parallel. A single domain adopts any
 * global orphaned entries tables, and then each domain scans its own
 * roots.
 *
 * 3.2. Updating block status.
 *
 * After a major or minor GC, memprof has to check tracked blocks to
 * discover whether they have survived the GC, or (for a minor GC)
 * whether they have been promoted to the major heap. This is done by
 * caml_memprof_after_minor_gc() and caml_memprof_after_major_gc(),
 * which share the system for iterating over entries tables as used by
 * caml_memprof_scan_roots(). Again, these functions are called by all
 * domains in parallel; a single domain starts by adopting any global
 * orphaned entries tables, and then each domain updates its own
 * entries.
 *
 * 3.3. Compaction
 *
 * GC compaction may move all objects in the major heap, so all
 * memprof roots must be scanned and potentially updated, including
 * the weak roots (i.e. pointers to the tracked blocks). This is done
 * by the same caml_memprof_scan_roots() function as root scanning in
 * regular GCs, using a boolean argument to indicate that weak roots
 * should also be scanned.
 *
 * 4. Random Number Generation
 *
 * 4.1. Requirements
 *
 * We sample every word of allocation with the same probability
 * (lambda, usually very small) - a Bernoulli trial. For the
 * allocation of a block on the shared heap, or any allocation from
 * the C runtime, we need to know how many samples we make of that
 * block (usually zero). This is a **binomial random variable**,
 * parameterized by lambda and N (the number of words in the block,
 * including the header).
 *
 * For allocations by Caml on the minor heap, we use the existing GC
 * trigger mechanism, to cause Caml to enter the runtime when "the
 * next sample" is due. The amount of allocation before "the next
 * sample" is a **geometric random variable**, parameterized by
 * lambda.
 *
 * 4.2. Implementation
 *
 * We focus on generating geometric pseudo-random numbers (PRNs), and
 * simulate binomial PRNs for parameters (lambda, N) by counting
 * geometric PRNs for lambda which sum to no more than N.
 *
 * We use a high-quality high-performance 32-bit uniform PRNG
 * (xoshiro128+), with per-domain state vectors. We initialize the
 * per-domain state vector with a low-quality PRNG (SplitMX64), seeded
 * separately for each domain.
 *
 * To convert from a uniform PRN `u` to a geometric PRN `g`, we compute
 *
 *          g = floor(1 + log(u) / log(1-lambda))
 *
 * where we treat u as uniformly distributed in [0,1]. We pre-compute
 * 1/log(1-lambda) (called `one_log1m_lambda` here), and compute
 * log(u) using a combination of type punning and a 3rd-degree
 * polynomial (see `log_approx()`).
 *
 * For further efficiency we generate geometric PRNs in blocks, and
 * the generating code is designed to be vectorizable.
 *
 * 5. Backtraces
 *
 * We have to be able to sample the current backtrace at any
 * allocation point, and pass it (as a Caml array) to the allocation
 * callback. We assume that in most cases these backtraces have short
 * lifetimes, so we don't want to allocate them on the shared
 * heap. However, we can't always allocate them directly on the Caml
 * minor heap, as some allocations (e.g. allocating in the shared heap
 * from the runtime) may take place at points at which GC is not safe
 * (and so minor-heap allocation is not permitted).  In those cases we
 * "stash" the backtrace on the C heap, and copy it onto the Caml heap
 * when we are about to call the allocation callback.
 *
 * 6. Sampling
 *
 * We sample allocation for all threads in a domain which has a
 * currently sampling profile, except when such a thread is running a
 * memprof callback, which "suspends" sampling on that thread.
 *
 * Allocation sampling divides into two cases: one simple and one
 * complex.
 *
 * 6.1. Simple Sampling
 *
 * When sampling an allocation by the runtime (as opposed to
 * allocation by Caml), an entry is added to the thread's entry table,
 * for subsequent processing. No allocation callback is called at
 * allocation time, because the heap may not be consistent so
 * allocation by the callback is not safe (see "Backtraces").
 *
 * 6.2. Minor Heap Caml Allocation Sampling
 *
 * Caml code allocates on the minor heap by pointer-bumping, and only
 * drops into the runtime if the `young_ptr` allocation pointer hits
 * the `young_trigger`, usually triggering a garbage collection. When
 * profiling, we set the trigger at the next word which we want to
 * sample (see "Random Number Generation"), thus allowing us to enter
 * memprof code at the approporiate allocation point. However,
 * sampling the allocation is more complex in this case for several
 * reasons:
 *
 * - Deferred allocation. A sampled block is not actually allocated
 *   until the runtime returns to the GC poll point in Caml code,
 *   after the memprof sampling code has run. So we have to predict
 *   the address of the sampled block for the entry record, to track
 *   its future promotion or collection. Until the allocation callback
 *   has run, instead of the allocated block address, the entry holds
 *   the offset in words of the block within the combined allocation,
 *   and the entry's `offset` field is set.
 *
 * - Combined allocations. A single GC poll point in Caml code may
 *   combine the allocation of several distinct blocks, each of which
 *   may be sampled independently. We create an entry for each sampled
 *   block and then run all allocation callbacks.
 *
 * - Prompt allocation callbacks. We call allocation callbacks
 *   directly from memprof as we sample the allocated blocks. These
 *   callbacks could be deferred (as are the ones in the "Simple
 *   Sampling" case), but that would require twice as many entries
 *   into memprof code. So the allocation callback is called before
 *   the sampled block is actually allocated (see above), and several
 *   allocation callbacks may be called at any given GC poll point
 *   (due to combined allocations). We take care to arrange heap
 *   metadata such that it is safe to run allocation callbacks (which
 *   may allocate and trigger minor and major GCs).
 *
 * - Other callbacks. In order to call the allocation callbacks from
 *   the poll point, we process the thread's entries table. This may
 *   call other callbacks for the same thread (specifically: deferred
 *   "Simple Sampling" callbacks).
 *
 * - Callback effects. Any callback may raise an exception, stop
 *   sampling, start a new profile, and/or discard a profile.
 *
 *   If a callback raises an exception, none of the allocations from
 *   the current poll point will take place. However, some allocation
 *   callbacks may already have been called. If so, we mark those
 *   entries as "deallocated", so that matching deallocation callbacks
 *   will run. We simply delete any tracking entry from the current
 *   poll point which has not yet run an allocation callback. Then we
 *   propagate the exception up to Caml.
 *
 *   If a callback stops sampling, subsequent allocations from the
 *   current poll point will not be sampled.
 *
 *   If a callback stops sampling and starts a new profile, none of
 *   the allocations from the current poll point are subsequently
 *   tracked (through promotion and/or deallocation), as it's not
 *   possible to reconstruct the allocation addresses of the tracking
 *   entries, so they are simply deleted (or marked as deallocated, as
 *   in the exceptional case). The new profile effectively begins with
 *   the following poll point or other allocation.
 *
 * Most of this complexity is managed in caml_memprof_sample_young().
 *
 * 7. Callbacks
 *
 * Some callbacks are run at allocation time, for allocations from
 * Caml (see under "Sampling" above). Other allocation callbacks, and
 * all post-allocation callbacks, are run during
 * `caml_memprof_run_callbacks_exn()`, which is called by the
 * runtime's general pending-action mechanism at poll points.
 *
 * We set the domain's action-pending flag when we notice we have
 * pending callbacks. Caml drops into the runtime at a poll point, and
 * calls `caml_memprof_run_callbacks_exn()`, whenever the
 * action-pending flag is set, whether or not memprof set it. So
 * memprof maintains its own per-domain `pending` flag, to avoid
 * suspending/unsuspending sampling, and checking all the entries
 * tables, when there are no pending callbacks.
 *
 * This is particularly important because when we unsuspend sampling,
 * we reset the young-limit, which has the side-effect of setting the
 * domain's action-pending flag. TODO: consider changing
 * `caml_reset_young_limit` so it doesn't do this.
 *
 * Allocation callbacks are always run by the thread which made the
 * allocation, unless that thread terminates before running the
 * callback, in which case it is inherited by the domain.
 *
 * Callbacks are run by iterating through candidate entries in a entry
 * table. See under "Entries" above. A single entry may have more than
 * one callback to run (if, for example, it has been promoted *and*
 * garbage collected since the last time callbacks for that entry were
 * run) - they are run in the natural order.
