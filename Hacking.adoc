= Hacking the compiler üê´

Welcome! The purpose of this document is to gather various advices on how to get started in compiler hacking.

=== Tips and tools

1. Install https://github.com/gasche/opam-compiler-conf[opam-compiler-conf].

2. Consult link:INSTALL.adoc[] for build instructions. Here is the gist of it:
+
----
opam compiler-conf configure
make -j world
----

3. Try the newly built toplevel:
+
----
make runtop
----

4. Hack frenetically.

5. Install in a new opam switch to try things out:
+
----
opam compiler-conf install
----

6. You did it, Well done! Consult link:CONTRIBUTING.md[] to send your contribution upstream.

See <<Annex,the end of this document>> for various helpful commands.

=== What to do

There is always a lot of potential tasks, both for old and newcomers. Here are various potential projects:

* http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/view_all_bug_page.php[The OCaml bugtracker].
In particular the tag http://caml.inria.fr/mantis/search.php?project_id=1&sticky_issues=1&sortby=last_updated&dir=DESC&highlight_changed=24&hide_status_id=90&tag_string=junior_job[junior_job].
* https://github.com/ocamllabs/compiler-hacking/wiki/Things-to-work-on[OCamllabs compiler-hacking wiki].
* Documentation improvements are always most appreciated, either in the various mli files or in the official manual (See link:manual/README.md[]).

== Libraries and tools

link:stdlib/[]:: The standard library. Each file is mostly independent and should not need further knowledge.

link:otherlibs/[]:: External libraries such as +unix+, +threads+, +dynlink+, +str+ and +bigarray+.

link:lex/[]:: The +ocamllex+ lexer generator.

link:yacc/[]:: The +ocamlyacc+ parser generator. Please consider contributing to link:http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/[menhir] instead.


== The compiler

The compiler code base can be intimidating at first sight. Here are a few pointers to get started.

=== The frontend -- link:parsing/[] and link:typing/[]

The frontend handles parsing and typing of the OCaml code. It also contains various utilies needed for the later phases of the compiler.

link:parsing/parsetree.mli[Parsetree] and link:parsing/asttypes.mli[Asttypes]:: +Parsetree+ is an AST of the surface language of OCaml. It is well annotated with examples and is a mandatory read before any further exploration of the compiler.

link:parsing/location.mli[Location]:: This module contains utilities related to locations and error handling. In particular, it contains handler that are used for all the error reporting in the compiler.

==== The typechecker -- link:typing/[]

The code for the OCaml typechecker is complex. Modifying it will need a good understanding of the OCaml type system and type inference. Here is a reading list, by growing order of difficulty, that should help you understand the typechecker better:

http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/u3-ocaml/index.html[Using, Understanding, and Unraveling the OCaml Language by Didier R√©my] :: provides (among other things) a formal description of parts of the core OCaml language, starting by a simple Core ML.

http://okmij.org/ftp/ML/generalization.html[Efficient and Insightful Generalization by Oleg Kiselyov] :: describes the basis of the algorithm used by the OCaml type checker.

After that, the best is probably to dive right in. There is no real "point of entry", but understanding of both the parsetree and the typedtree is probably necessary.

The datastructures ::
+link:typing/types.mli[Types]+ and +link:typing/typedtree.mli[Typedtree]+ are the two main datastructures in the typechecker. They correspond to the surface language annotated with all the information needed for type checking and type inference. +link:typing/env.mli[Env]+ contains all the environments that are used in the typechecker. Each node in the typedtree is annotated with the local environment.

Core utilities ::
+link:typing/btype.mli[Btype]+ and +link:typing/ctype.mli[Ctype]+ contains the various low level function needed for typing, in particular related to levels, unification and backtracking. +link:typing/mtype.mli[Mtype]+ contains utilities related to modules.

Inference and checking::
The +Type..+ modules are related to inference and typechecking, each for a different part of the language. +link:typing/typetexp.mli[Typetexp]+ for type expressions, +link:typing/typecore.mli[Typecore]+ for the core language, +link:typing/typecore.mli[Typemod]+ for modules, +link:typing/typedecl.mli[Typedecl]+ for type declarations and finally +link:typeclass.mli[Typeclass]+ for the object system.

Subtyping::
Handling of subtyping relations are separated in the +Include...+ modules. +link:typing/includecore.ml[Includecore]+ for the core language, +link:typing/includemod.mli[Includemod]+ for modules and finally +link:typing/includeclass.mli[Includeclass]+ for the object system.

=== The native compiler -- link:middle_end/[] and link:asmcomp/[]

=== The driver -- link:driver/[]

=== Useful Makefile targets

Besides the targets listed in link:INSTALL.adoc[] for build and
installation, the following targets may be of use:

+make runtop+ :: builds and runs the ocaml toplevel of the distribution
                          (optionally uses `rlwrap` for readline+history support)
+make natruntop+:: builds and runs the native ocaml toplevel (experimental)

+make partialclean+:: Clean the OCaml files but keep the compiled C files.

+make depend+:: Regenerate the +.depend+ file. Should be used each time new dependencies are added between files.

=== Bootstrapping

The OCaml compiler is bootstrapped. This means that a previous version of the OCaml compiler (along with various tools and a compiled version of the standard library) is included in the repository under the link:boot/[] directory.
Details can be found in link:INSTALL.adoc#bootstrap[INSTALL.adoc].
