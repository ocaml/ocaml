(* Regression test for PR#4466: select timeout with simultaneous read
   and write on socket in Windows. *)

(* Scenario:
     - thread [server] implements a simple 'echo' server on a socket
     - thread [reader] selects then reads from a socket connected to
       the echo server and copies to standard output
     - main program executes [writer], which writes to the same socket
       (the one connected to the echo server)
*)
