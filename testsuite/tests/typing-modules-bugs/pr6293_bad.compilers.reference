                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Error: In this `with' constraint, the new definition of t
       does not match its original definition in the constrained signature:
       Type declarations do not match:
         type t
       is not included in
         type t = { a : int; b : int; }
       The first is abstract, but the second is a record.
