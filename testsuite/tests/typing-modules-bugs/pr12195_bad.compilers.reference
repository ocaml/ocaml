Error: Signature mismatch:
       Modules do not match:
         sig type s = A val created : '_weak1 Foo.t end
       is not included in
         Bar
       Values do not match:
         val created : '_weak1 Foo.t
       is not included in
         val created : s Foo.t
       The type '_weak1 Foo.t is not compatible with the type s Foo.t
       The type constructor s would escape its scope
