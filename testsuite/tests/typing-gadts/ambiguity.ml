(* First reported in MPR#7617: the typechecker arbitrarily picks a
   representative for an ambivalent type escaping its scope.
   The commit that was implemented poses problems of its own: we are now
   unifying the type of the patterns in the environment of each pattern, instead
   of the outer one. The code discussed in PR#7617 passes because each branch
   contains the same equation, but consider the following cases: *)
