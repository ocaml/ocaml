Error: This type entity = < destroy_subject : id subject; entity_id : id >
       should be an instance of type

       Type (id subject, id) observer = < notify : id subject -> id -> unit >
       is not compatible with type

         entity_container as 'd =
           < add_entity : 'a -> 'b; notify : 'a -> id -> unit >
       The method add_observer has type (id subject, id) observer -> unit,
       but the expected method type was
       < destroy_subject : < add_observer : 'e; .. >; .. > entity_container ->
       'b as 'e
