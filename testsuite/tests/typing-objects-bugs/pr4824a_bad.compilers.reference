Error: Signature mismatch:
       ...
       Class declarations do not match:
         class c : 'a -> object val x : 'a end
       does not match
         class c : 'a -> object val x : 'b end
       The instance variable x has type 'a but is expected to have type 'b
       This instance of 'b is ambiguous:
       it would escape the scope of its equation
