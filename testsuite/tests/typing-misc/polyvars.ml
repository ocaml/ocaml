Error: This recursive type is not regular.
       The type constructor a is defined as
         type ('a, 'b, 'c, 'd, 'e) a
       but it is used as
         ('e, 'c, 'b, 'd, 'a) a

         ('d, 'a, 'e, 'c, 'b) b = [ `B of ('e, 'c, 'b, 'd, 'a) c ],

       All uses need to match the definition for the recursive type to be regular.
