(** Test for level 0 headings 
 
  {1 Level 1} 
   
   Standard heading levels start at 1.

  {0 Level 0}
  A level 0 heading is guaranted to be at the same level that
  the main heading of the module.

  This setup allows users to start their standard heading at level 1 rather 
  than 2, without losing the ability to add global level heading, 
  when, if ever, such heading is warranted
