# Available predicates:
#   win32     => building a native Windows system (UNIX_OR_WIN32=win32)
#   system-*  => building a specific SYSTEM
#   !system-* => NOT building a specific SYSTEM
#   arch-*    => building a specific ARCH
#   bytecode  => testing bytecode only (BYTECODE_ONLY=true)
#   !fortran  => no FORTRAN compiler is available (FORTRAN_COMPILER=)
#   !csharp   => no C# compiler is available
#   !unix     => unix library not built (includes native Windows)
#   !flambda  => flambda not enabled (FLAMBDA=false)
