Test constantly-false predicates
Constantly-false predicates are outside the spec,
but we ask them to return [max_int] rather than loop or crash.

Test non-monotonous predicates
Non-monotonous predicates are outside the spec,
but we ask them to find a satisfying value rather than loop or crash
as long as they are asymptotically true.


All tests succeeded.
