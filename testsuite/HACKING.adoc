== Running the testsuite

== Creating a new test

== Useful Makefile targets

`make parallel`::
  runs the tests in parallel using the
  link:https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/[GNU parallel] tool: tests run
  twice as fast with no difference in output order.

`make all-foo`, `make parallel-foo`::
  runs only the tests in the directories whose name starts with `foo`:
  `parallel-typing`, `all-lib`, etc.

`make one DIR=tests/foo`::
  runs only the tests in the directory `tests/foo`. This is often equivalent to
  `cd tests/foo && make`, but sometimes the latter breaks the test makefile if
  it contains fragile relative filesystem paths. Such errors should be fixed if
  you find them, but `make one DIR=...` is the more reliable option as it runs
  exactly as `make all` which is heavily tested.

`make promote DIR=tests/foo`::
  most test run a program and compare the result of the program, store in a file
  `foo.result`, with a reference output stored in `foo.reference` -- the test
  fails if the two output differ. Sometimes a change in result is innocuous, it
  comes from an intended change in output instead of a regression.
  `make promote` copies the new result file into the reference file, making the
  test pass again. Whenever you use this rule please check carefully, using
  `git diff`, that the change really corresponds to an intended output
  difference, and not to a regression. You then need to commit the change to
  reference file, and your commit message should explain why the output changed.
